 * Helper interface for use with the RiceXmlExportList class.
 *

 * assigns an instance of RiceXmlExportList to the appropriate list field/property, and gives the
 * list an implementation of this interface for the list to invoke whenever it needs to create a new
 * instance of the next child element. This allows the implementation to create and then discard
 * child elements during marshalling.
 * 
 * @param E The type that the list is expected to return.
 * @param T The type that the list stores internally and passes to the listener for conversion as needed.
