/**
 * AttributeValueReader defines classes that encapsulate access to both dictionary metadata and object field values
 *
 * <p>For example, by reflection
 * and introspection, for the purpose of performing validation against constraints defined in the
 * DictionaryValidationService implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Practically speaking, this interface should only need to be implemented by a small number of classes. The two
 * major use cases are for
 * <ol>
 * <li> a dictionary object with members</li>
 * <li> a specific member of a dictionary object</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the first case, implementing classes should provide access to all underlying members of the object via reflection
 * or some other mechanism.
 * In the second case, implementing classes only need to provide access to the value associated with that specific
 * member, and constraints
 * requiring access to additional members will be skipped.</p>
