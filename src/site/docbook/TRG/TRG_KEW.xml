        <sect2>
            <title>What is workflow, in general?</title>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Workflow</emphasis> is a very general term and means
                different things in different contexts. For example, it may mean the sequence of
                approvals needed for a Leave Request or it may refer to a complex scientific
                procedure. </para>
            <para>In our context of enterprise applications within a higher education institution,
                we're usually talking about business process management when we discuss workflow.
                Usually, this revolves around business rules, authorizations, and routing for
                approval.</para>
            <para>A simple example is a leave request system. It needs some workflow to get the
                necessary people (supervisor, etc.) to approve it. This is one example of the
                routing and approval side of a workflow.</para>
            <para>You may also have business rules in workflow that dictate that some people get
                automatic approval for leave requests. This is a business rule detail that workflow
                executes by automatically routing these types of requests past the approval
                steps.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>What is Kuali Enterprise Workflow, in particular?</title>
            <para>The Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW) product revolves around routing and approval
                of documents. It is a stand-alone <emphasis role="italic">workflow engine</emphasis>
                upon which you can integrate other enterprise applications to do routing and
                approvals.</para>
            <para>In addition, KEW contains an <emphasis role="bold">eDocLite</emphasis> system.
                This is a mechanism to create simple data-entry forms directly in KEW. You can also
                create routing rules around eDocLite forms. eDocLite forms are the rough equivalent
                of the basic, one- or two-page forms that are commonly used to process business and
                get signature approvals. </para>
            <para>The benefit of eDocLite in KEW is that it does <emphasis role="italic"
                    >not</emphasis> require a separate application. You can use eDocLite in KEW
                simply by setting up the forms that your institution or department needs.</para>
            <para>Overall, KEW is based on documents. In KEW, each document has a collection of
                transactions or <emphasis role="italic">things to be done</emphasis>. Each
                transaction is approved or denied individually in KEW.</para>
            <para>For example, John Doe may use a <emphasis role="italic">Leave Request</emphasis>
                document in KEW to ask for a week off in June. The KEW Leave Request document
                contains enough information for his supervisor to make a decision about John’s
                leave. (The document may use data keys to retrieve external information, such as
                John’s past Leave Requests and available hours.) Once John submits his Leave
                Request, KEW routes it to John's supervisor for approval. Depending on how John’s
                department has configured KEW for routing Leave Requests, after John’s supervisor
                approves or denies his request, KEW may route it to more people for further action
                to be taken.</para>
            <para>Once John’s Leave Request document is processed, it triggers a <emphasis
                    role="bold">PostProcessor</emphasis>, which can peform any desired additional
                processing. This is most commonly used to “finalize” the business transaction once
                all approvers have signed off on it. In this particular example, it might call
                another service that would update records in the Leave Request application’s
                database, indicating that the individual has successfully scheduled leave during
                that time period. </para>
            <para>In addition, the KEW <emphasis role="bold">PostProcessor</emphasis> contains hooks
                for all the stages that a document goes through. For example, an external
                application may use a KEW workflow for routing and approval of documents, and that
                application may take action at each change in state of a routed document.</para>

            <title>What problems or functions does KEW solve? </title>
            <para>The primary benefit of KEW workflow is the correct routing for approval of
                documents. It enforces your business-specific rules about who needs to approve what
                documents, in which scenarios.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Simple Workflow Example</emphasis></para>
            <para>Leave Request: Each person has one other person (possibly more) who needs to
                approve his or her leave requests. In this context, KEW is the system that
                manages both the approval structure and the leave requests themselves (the
                actual approvals).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">More Complex Workflow Example</emphasis></para>
            <para>Purchasing Desktop Computers: You may need several business rules in KEW for
                this, such as a rule to enforce:<orderedlist>

                        <para>A strategic alliance requires that you buy from one vendor unless
                            there is a justification to not do so </para>

            <para>In this example, KEW requires an approval if:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>

                    </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>The workflow also requires an approval by the signer (or delegate) for each
                spending account that you use for the purchase.</para>
            <para>In KEW, <emphasis role="bold">Approval Types</emphasis> are set up such as account
                approver, supervisor, or organizational/department hierarchy approver. An Approval
                Type contains the applicable routing and approval rules. Once you create an approval
                type, those routing and approval rules are available for other workflow clients and
                scenarios. This creates a <emphasis role="italic">tipping point</emphasis>
                situation, in which the more applications and business processes you set up through
                workflow, the easier it gets to do new ones.</para>
            <para>In addition, KEW can help you with distributed management of approval structures.
                Each group at your institution (each college, unit, division, etc.) can create their
                own approval and workflow structure for their group, and you can centrally manage
                the workflow above those groups. This allows groups to manage their own internal
                controls and structures, while still being subject to higher-level institutional
                controls.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>What problems does KEW NOT solve?</title>
            <para>KEW is not a general-purpose application builder. For complex applications, you
                need to develop applications separately and then integrate them with KEW. For simple
                forms or documents that need approval, you can use <emphasis role="bold"
                    >eDocLite</emphasis>, but this only works in simple cases, analogous to a one-
                or two-page paper form that requires signatures. It is important to note, however,
                that Kuali Rice does include a framework called the Kuali Nervous System (KNS) that
                can be used to facilitate the development of more complex applications and includes
                built-in integration with KEW.</para>
            <para>KEW is not a general-purpose business rules engine. For example, it does not know
                that a continuation account must be specified when an account is closed. Those types
                of rules are the responsibility of the application itself to manage. However, this
                is not a clear-cut line, as KEW does manage business rules that directly affect
                routing and approval.</para>
            <para>KEW is not an Organization Hierarchy manager. For example, it will not
                automatically manage your organizational hierarchies and internal structures.
                However, integration with these hierarchies and structures can be accomplished using
                KEW, and leveraging such hierarchies for routing and approval is a very common need
                for many applications.</para>

        <sect2>
            <title>With which applications can KEW integrate?</title>
            <para>Nearly anything, in theory. In the current version of KEW, any application can
                access KEW if it can:<itemizedlist>

            <title> Can I use KEW without building an entire application?</title>
            <para>Yes, absolutely! </para>
            <para>KEW is an incredibly powerful platform for routing and approval for enterprise
                (i.e., large) applications. However, it also includes <emphasis role="bold"
                    >eDocLite</emphasis>, which makes it easy to develop simple business-process
                forms and run them through KEW. In this situation, in its most simple form, you can
                do all of your work within KEW, and most of that work is in developing your form
                configurations. If needed, the eDocLite process can also hook into a post-processor
                to take an action once a document's approvals are complete.</para>

        <title>Steps to Building a KEW Application</title>
        <sect2>
            <title>Preface</title>
            <para>In its simplest form, KEW is merely a set of services that can be used to submit
                documents to a workflow engine and then interact with those documents as the
                progress through the routing process. Therefore, there are many different ways to
                build an application that uses KEW. Kuali Rice itself has a few built-in solutions
                (eDocLite and KNS) that make it easier to build applications that use KEW.
                Alternatively, an application can be built from scratch or retrofitted to use
                KEW.</para>
            <para>In this section, we will look at some common approaches to designing and building
                an application which leverages KEW. However, it is by no means exhaustive and is
                simply meant to get you started and give you ideas as you embark upon development of
                your own applications that use Kuali Enterprise Workflow.</para>

            <para>Along with the previous embedded configurations, KEW also allows for Remote Java

                Configuration of the remote client is similar to that of the embedded client, except
                that no embedded KEW engine gets set up; instead, the client relies on the service

                (note that secure access is required for the KIM services). In order to configure
                the thin client, the following configuration properties need to be defined.</para>

                <title>Custom Servlet Filters</title>
                <para>When running a Standalone Rice Server, you may want to implement your own
                    filters for authentication purposes. The system comes with a special filter that
                    will read filter definitions and mappings from the configuration system. </para>
                <para>The Bootstrap Filter is a generic filter that is applied to all web requests,
                    which then delegates to any filters and are setup through the default
                    configuration. This mechanism allows registration of institution-specific
                    filters without the necessity of modifying the web application configuration
                    file (/WEB-INF/web.xml) within the standalone webapp.</para>
                <para>Filter syntax is as follows:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filter.filter name.class">class name of filter&lt;/param></programlisting>
                <para>filter name is an arbitrary name for your filter:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filter.myfilter.class">edu.institution.organization.MyFilter&lt;/param></programlisting>
                <para>Any number of configuration parameters may be defined for a given filter as
                    follows:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filter.filter name.filter param name">filter param value&lt;/param></programlisting>
                <para>For example:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filter.myfilter.color">red&lt;/param>

&lt;param name="filter.myfilter.shape">square&lt;/param>
</programlisting>
                <para>For custom filters to be invoked, they must first be mapped to requests. That
                    is done via the filter mapping parameter:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filtermapping.filter name.optional order index">path matching expression&lt;/param></programlisting>
                <para><emphasis role="italic">filter name</emphasis> is the name of your previously
                    defined filter, <emphasis role="italic">optional order index</emphasis> is an
                    optional integer used to specify the position of the filter in the invocation
                    order, and <emphasis role="italic">path matching expression</emphasis> is a
                    Servlet-specification-compatible url pattern. </para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filtermapping.myfilter.1">/special/path/&lt;/param></programlisting>
                <para>If an order index is not specified, it is assumed to be 0. Filters with
                    equivalent order are ordered arbitrarily with relation to each other (not in
                    order of filter or mapping definition). A full example follows:</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;param name="filter.myfilter.class">edu.institution.organization.MyFilter&lt;/param>

&lt;param name="filter.myfilter.color">red&lt;/param>

            <para>KEW can send emails to notify users about items in their Action List (depending on
                user preferences). Email in KEW uses the JavaMail library. In order to configure
                email, you will need to configure the appropriate JavaMail properties. A list of
                those properties can be found at the end of the page at the following url: <link
                    xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/javax/mail/package-summary.html"

            <para>In addition to these standard JavaMail properties, you can also set the following
                optional properties to configure simple SMTP authentication.</para>

            <para>In order for KEW to send out emails, several steps need to be done. In order to
                have KEW send out any emails, the “SEND_EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_IND” KNS System Parameter
                needs to be set to ‘Y’. For emails to real people, the environment code must be set
                to ‘prd’. If this is not set to ‘prd’, an email can still be sent out to a test
                address. This test address is set by the KNS System Parameter,
                “EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_TEST_ADDRESS”. Emails sent in a test system will only be sent to
                the address specified by the EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_TEST_ADDRESS. The “from” address may
                also be set with a System Parameter. To do this, set the “FROM_ADDRESS” System
                Parameter to the email address you want the KEW emails sent from. If the
                FROM_ADDRESS parameter doesn’t exist or isn’t set, it will default to
                “admin@localhost”.</para>

            <title>Outbox Configuration</title>
            <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Outbox</emphasis> is a standard feature on the <emphasis
                    role="bold">Action List</emphasis> and is visible to the user in the UI by
                default. When the Outbox is turned on, users can access it from the Outbox hyperlink
                at the top of the Action List.</para>
            <para>The Outbox is implemented by heavily leveraging existing Action List code. When an
                    <emphasis role="bold">Action Item</emphasis> is deleted from the Action Item
                table as the result of a user action, the item is stored in the <emphasis
                    role="bold">KEW_OUT_BOX_ITM_T</emphasis> table, using the <emphasis role="bold"
                    >org.kuali.rice.kew.actionitem.OutboxItemActionListExtension</emphasis> object.
                This object is an extension of the <emphasis role="bold"
                    >ActionItemActionListExtension</emphasis>. The separate object exists to provide
                a bean for OJB mapping.</para>
            <para>The Workflow Preferences determine if the Outbox is visible and functioning for
                each user. The preference is called <emphasis role="bold">Use Outbox</emphasis>. In
                addition, you can configure the Outbox at the KEW level using the parameter
                tag:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;param name="actionlist.outbox">true&lt;/param></programlisting>
            <para>When the Outbox is set to <emphasis role="italic">false</emphasis>, the preference
                for individual users to configure the Outbox is turned off. By default, the Outbox
                is set to true at the KEW level. You can turn the Outbox off (to hide it from users)
                by setting the property below to <emphasis role="italic">false</emphasis>:</para>

        <title>KEW Administration Guide</title>
        <para>This guide provides information on administering a Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW)
            installation. Out of the box, KEW comes with a default setup that works well in
            development and test environments. However, when moving to a production environment,
            this setup requires adjustments. This document discusses basic administration as well as
            instructions for working with some of KEW’s administration tools.</para>
        <sect2>
            <title>Configuration Overview</title>
            <para>You configure KEW primarily through the <emphasis role="bold"
                    >workflow.xml</emphasis> file. Please see the KEW Configuration Parameters guide
                for more information on initial configuration of a KEW installation.</para>

            <para>Application Constants are the configuration elements in KEW. Each constant is
                modifiable at system runtime; any changes take effect immediately in KEW.
                Application Constants are stored in a cluster-safe cache and propagated across all
                machines when change occurs. For more information about Application Constants,
                please refer to Application Constants.</para>

            <para>When rolling KEW out into a production environment, there are application
                constants which you may need to change:<itemizedlist>

                            This is usually set to false in test environments so emails aren’t
                            generated during testing. Usually, this is set this to true in a
                            production environment to allow email notifications. You also need to
                            ensure that your email service is configured properly to allow KEW to
                            send notifications. </para>

                            purposes. It is recommended that you set this value to false in a

                            production hardware. If it's set too high, KEW may use so much of the
                            CPU that other applications running on the same machine are adversely
                            impacted. </para>

                            environments, users tend to be more sensitive to immediate feedback
                            since they may be testing processes over the course of a couple minutes
                            that, in practice, occur over a number of days. In test environments, it
                            is recommended that you keep this value low. In a production
                            environment, you can reasonably increase this value without affecting
                            the speed at which documents are routed. This reduces thrashing on the
                            route queue. </para>

                            queue to be distributed across the entire cluster, which enhances

                            constant, in a test environment it is important to find out as quickly

            <para>The Message Queue is the main scheduling mechanism in KEW. You use it to schedule
                documents for asynchronous routing and to queue arbitrary units of work. When KEW
                places a document into exception routing, it may become stuck after a series of
                failed attempts. You can use the Route Queue UI to resolve this issue, as well as to
                fix new entries, if needed.</para>

        <title>Defining Workflow Processes Using Document Types</title>
        <para>A Document Type is an object that brings workflow components together into a cohesive
            unit (routing configuration). One of its primary responsibilities is to define the
            routing path for a document. The routing path is the process definition for the
            document. It can consist of various types of nodes that perform certain actions, such as
            sending action requests to responsible parties, transmitting emails, or splitting the
            route path into parallel branches. </para>
        <para>In addition to the routing path, it contains the Post Processor which receives event
            callbacks from the engine, the DocHandler which is the access point into the client
            application from the Action List and Access Control for certain actions. It can also
            define various policies that control how documents of that type are processed by the
            workflow engine. </para>

                                    Originally, KEW only supported sequential routing paths (as
                                    opposed to those with splits and joins). The KEW <emphasis
                                        role="bold">getDocRouteLevel()</emphasis> API returns an
                                    integer that represents the numerical step in the routing
                                    process. This number only has meaning for those documents that
                                    define sequential routing.

        <title>Defining Workflow Processes Using PeopleFlow - a new feature in KEW</title>
        <para>PeopleFlow is our Kuali Rice instantiation of the "maps" concept included in the
            original Coeus. For all intents and purposes it's a prioritized list of people to send
            requests to. PeopleFlow gives you a new type of request activation strategy called
            "priority-parallel" to activate requests generated from a PeopleFlow in the appropriate
            order. Essentially, it's like a mini people-based workflow that doesn't require you to
            specify a KEW node in the document type for each individual who might need to approve or
            be notified. You can define "Stops" in a PeopleFlow, where everything in the same stop
            proceeds in parallel, but all must be done within the stop before proceeding to the next
            stop. </para>
        <para>You can call/execute a PeopleFlow from within a KEW workflow node directly, or you can
            invoke the Kuali Rules Managment System (KRMS) engine from an application and any
            PeopleFlows that get selected during rule execution, defined in a KRMS agenda, will be
            called. In this way, you can integrate business rules across applications and workflows. </para>
        <para>The same PeopleFlow that defines a routing order among a set of persons, groups or
            roles can be called by KRMS rules, with the KRMS rules defining which type of  request
            to pass to the PeopleFlow (for example, an "approval" routing action or a
            "notification").   </para>
        <para>KRMS is also a new feature in Rice 2.0.  See the KRMS Technical Guide for more
            information on KRMS.    </para>
        <para>You can define a PeopleFlow (simple workflow) via a maintenance document.  See the KEW
            Users' Guide for additional details on defining a PeopleFlow.</para>

        <title>KEW Routing Components and Configuration Guide</title>
        <para>KEW has several components that you can use to configure routing. Typically a single

            to import into KEW. See Importing XML Files to KEW for more information. </para>

            <para>When you define a responsibility in KIM using this template, you specify a value
                for each of these details. When a document is routed using responsibility-based
                routing nodes, KIM receives the type of the document being routed and the name of
                the node; it then locates any responsibilities which have the same routing node name
                and either the same document type name or the name of a parent document type (all
                the way up to the top of the hierarchy). The list of people who gets the request
                consists of anyone who has been assigned a role with any of the matching
                responsibilities.</para>

        <title>Using the Workflow Document API</title>
        <sect2>
            <title>Overview</title>
            <para>This document explains features of the workflow document API. There are two
                interfaces in KEW that allow you to create a document for delivery through workflow.
                The <emphasis role="bold">WorkflowDocument</emphasis> interface is designed to
                create a new document in the workflow system once an action has been taken, such as
                sending ad hoc requests. The <emphasis role="bold">WorkflowInfo</emphasis> interface
                is actually a convenience class for client applications that query workflow. Both
                classes assist with implementing connections to KEW. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>WorkflowDocument</title>
            <para>The process for this section of the API involves creating the initial <emphasis
                    role="bold">WorkflowDocument</emphasis> using a constructor to create a new
                routable document in KEW. Once the object is defined, it initializes by loading an
                existing <emphasis role="italic">routeHeaderId</emphasis> or by constructing an
                empty document of a specified <emphasis role="italic">documentType</emphasis>. A
                number of methods can be invoked once initialization is complete and details of how
                those methods would be invoked are outlined primarily in the Java Documentation at
                    <link xlink:href="https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/"
                    >https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/</link>.</para>
            <para>Document content methods modify the properties of a document’s content. A specific
                case is <emphasis role="italic">addAttributeDefinition()</emphasis>, where a
                    <emphasis role="italic">WorkflowAttribute</emphasis> is used to generate
                attribute document content that will be appended to the existing document content.
                Another case is adding a searchable attribute definition with the <emphasis
                    role="italic">addSearchableDefinition()</emphasis> method. More information on
                the various constructors, methods, and objects relating to the WorkflowDocument
                class is available in the Java documentation found at <link

        <sect2>
            <title>WorkflowInfo</title>
            <para>This class is the second client interface to KEW. The first time this object is
                initialized, the client configuration is accessed to determine how to connect to
                KEW. Methods invoked from this class can grab the routing header information based
                on the principleId, or return a set of Action Requests for a document that’s in
                route based on the <emphasis role="italic">routeHeaderId</emphasis>, the <emphasis
                    role="italic">nodeName</emphasis> and the <emphasis role="italic"
                    >principalId</emphasis>. More information on the various constructors, methods,
                and objects relating to the <emphasis role="italic">WorkflowInfo</emphasis> class is

            <para>eDocLite is a simple, form-based system that is built into Kuali Enterprise
                Workflow (KEW). It facilitates rapid development and implementation of simple
                documents and validation rules using XML. Use it for simple documents with simple
                route paths. You can integrate it with larger applications using a database layer
                post-processor component. </para>
            <para>eDocLite uses an XSLT style sheet for custom presentation and XML to define form
                fields. The actual form display is called an EDL. This diagram shows how these
                objects are related:</para>

                <title>XSLT Style Sheet</title>
                <para>The next section of the EDL XML file is the XSLT style sheet. It renders the
                    EDL that the browser will present and contains logic to determine how data is
                    rendered to the user.</para>
                <para>A major workhorse of the XSLT code is contained in a style sheet library
                    called <emphasis role="bold">widgets.xml</emphasis>. In the example below, it's
                    included in the style sheet using an <emphasis role="italic"
                        >xsl:include</emphasis> directive.</para>
                <para>Workflow Java classes have API’s that offer methods that supply valuable
                    information to the XSLT style sheet logic. XML allows you to interrogate the
                    current value of <emphasis role="italic">EDL</emphasis>-defined fields, and it
                    provides a variety of built-in functions.</para>
                <para>Together, these helpers allow the eDocLite style sheet programmer to focus on
                    rendering fields and titles using library (widget) calls and to perform
                    necessary logic using the constructs built into the XML language(<emphasis
                        role="bold">if</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">choose…when</emphasis>,
                    etc.).</para>
                <para>This is the area of eDocLite development that takes the longest and is the
                    most tedious. Much of what the eDocLite style sheet programmer writes focuses on
                    which fields and titles appear, in what order, to which users, and whether the
                    fields are <emphasis role="italic">readOnly</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic"
                        >editable</emphasis>, or <emphasis role="italic">hidden</emphasis>.</para>

                <para>The beginning portion of this style sheet defines some XSL variables that are
                    often useful to drive logic choices. For simplicity, this example uses very
                    little logic. </para>
                <para>The <emphasis role="italic">isPastInitiated</emphasis> variable drives whether
                    a user-defined EDL field renders readOnly or not. </para>
                <para>The <emphasis role="italic">mainform</emphasis> often serves to call some
                    common widget templates that add canned functionality. The <emphasis
                        role="italic">mainform</emphasis> then calls the <emphasis role="italic"
                        >mainBody</emphasis> template, which creates the html to render the
                    EDL-defined fields. The <emphasis role="italic">mainform</emphasis> then
                    (optional) calls the notes, buttons, and footer templates.</para>
                <para>The majority of your programming effort goes into the <emphasis role="italic"
                        >mainBody</emphasis>, where calls to <emphasis role="italic"
                        >widget_render</emphasis> generate much of the field-specific title and
                    value information. Various options can be passed into <emphasis role="italic"
                        >widgets_render</emphasis> to allow client events to be executed. The
                        <emphasis role="italic">mainBody</emphasis> is usually one or more html
                    tables and sometimes makes calls to programmer-defined sub-templates. The XSLT
                    stylesheet generates the HTML rendered by the browser.</para>
                <para>The main and repeating theme of the example involves calling <emphasis
                        role="italic">widget_render</emphasis> with the title of an EDL field,
                    followed by calling <emphasis role="italic">widget_render</emphasis> again with
                    the input field. Widgets are a wrapper for XSLT stylesheets that offer the
                    ability to create HTML. Paramters offer different ways to render HTML when
                    making calls to widgets. Note that the variable value <emphasis role="italic"
                        >$isPastInitiated</emphasis> is passed as a parameter to widgets_render so
                    that the html <emphasis role="italic">readOnly</emphasis> attribute is generated
                    when the form is past the initiator’s node.</para>

                        >Action</emphasis> button that routes the document to the next node. This

                <para>When the initiator submits the document, KEW adds that document to the Action

                    case, there is no further destination, so when the destination person or
                    workgroup approves the document, the document becomes <emphasis role="bold"

                    nodes for approvals or other actions. A document may bypass some of those nodes,

                <title>Rule Attributes</title>
                <para>The RuleAttribute is a mechanism that can relate directly to an edl field.
                    Most rule attributes are of the xml rule attribute type. This type uses an xpath
                    statement which is used by the workflow engine to match to a rule that fires or
                    does not fire. </para>
                <para>In the below example, it can be seen that the edl defined field named 'campus'
                    and its permissible values are defined. Then in the xpathexpression element
                    says; when the value in the edl field named 'campus' matches the rule that
                    contains 'IUB' the rule will fire. Or when the value in the edl field named
                    'campus' matches the rule that contains 'IUPUI' that rule will fire instead.
                    Rules firing route a document to a person or a workgroup of people. </para>
                <para>To make another rule attribute for a different field, clone this one, change
                    all references to the field 'campus' to your different edl field name. Then cut
                    and paste in the values section. Then in the edl definition, the new field must
                    carry the extra syntax 'attributeName='. For example the eld definition for
                    campus looks like this: </para>

                <title>What are custom document search attributes? </title>
                <para>Custom document search attributes are associated with a document type. They
                    specify which pieces of document data will be made searchable for documents of
                    that type. When you take action on a document in the workflow engine, a
                    background process extracts the custom search attributes from the document and
                    adds them to a database table where they can be queried as part of a custom
                    document search. These custom search attributes are defined and associated along
                    with document types in WorflowData XML files, and are added to Rice via the XML
                    ingester. They are defined within (using XPath notation)
                    /data/ruleAttributes/ruleAttribute tags, and are associated with specific
                    document types within /data/documentTypes/documentType/attributes/attribute

            <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Outbox</emphasis> is a standard feature on the <emphasis

                default. When the Outbox is turned on, users can access it from the <emphasis
                    role="italic">Outbox</emphasis> hyperlink at the top of the Action List.</para>
            <para>The Outbox is implemented by heavily leveraging existing Action List code. When an
                    <emphasis role="bold">Action Item</emphasis> is deleted from the Action Item
                table as the result of a user action, the item is stored in the <emphasis
                    role="bold">KEW_OUT_BOX_ITM_T</emphasis> table, using the <emphasis role="bold"
                    >org.kuali.rice.kew.actionitem.OutboxItemActionListExtension</emphasis> object.
                This object is an extension of the <emphasis role="bold"

            <para>The Workflow Preferences determine if the Outbox is visible and functioning for

            <programlisting>&lt;param name="actionlist.outbox">true&lt;/param></programlisting>
            <para>When the Outbox is set to <emphasis role="italic">false</emphasis>, the preference
                for individual users to configure the Outbox is turned off. By default, the Outbox
                is set to <emphasis role="italic">true</emphasis> at the KEW level. You can turn the

            <programlisting>public String getCustomEmailSubject();

public String getCustomEmailBody();
</programlisting>
            <para>Note that each of these values is appended to the end of either the subject or the
                body of the email. The rest of the email still uses the standard email
                content.</para>
            <para>Also, when implementing one of these components, the document is made available to
                you as a <emphasis role="bold">RouteHeaderDTO</emphasis> and the action request
                related to the notification is made available as an <emphasis role="bold"
                    >ActionRequestDTO</emphasis>.</para>
            <para>Once you have implemented the CustomEmailAttribute, you need to make it available
                to the KEW engine (either deployed in a plugin or available on the classpath when
                running embedded KEW).</para>

                <para>First, define the attribute:</para>

            <para>KEW provides an option for linking documents and BOs that are functionally
                related. The link between related documents is created and removed in a double link
                double delete fashion, which means: when a link is added/deleted from 1 document to
                another document, a link in the reverse direction is also added/deleted, this
                feature will garuantee that searching for linked documents can be done from either
                side of the link. Using this option, client applications can link documents by using
                document link API.</para>

            <para>KEW provides various options for reporting on and simulation of routing scenarios.
                There is a GUI for performing these reporting functions as well as an API that you
                can use to run routing reports against the system.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>The Routing Report Screen</title>
            <para>From the Rice main menu there is a link to the <emphasis role="bold">Routing
                    Report</emphasis> screen. From this set of screens you can enter various
                criteria for running reports against the routing engine. The output of this
                reporting is a simulated view of the <emphasis role="bold">Route Log</emphasis>,
                displaying the result of the report.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>The Report APIs</title>
            <para>The KEW client API also provides facilities for running reports against the
                routing engine. At the core of KEW is a <emphasis role="bold">Simulation
                    Engine</emphasis> that is responsible for running these types of reports. The
                method for executing these reports is on the Workflow Info object that is part of
                the client API. The method is defined:</para>
            <programlisting>public DocumentDetailVO routingReport(ReportCriteriaVO reportCriteria) throws WorkflowException;</programlisting>
            <para>This method takes the report criteria and returns the results of the routing
                report.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Report Criteria</title>
            <para>The routing report operates under two basic modes:<orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Reports that run against existing Documents </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Reports that simulate a Document from a Document Type </para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist></para>
            <para>In each these cases there are certain properties that you need to set on the
                ReportCriteriaVO to obtain the desired results.</para>
            <para>In the first case, the report runs against a document that has already been
                created in the system. This document already has a Document Id and may be en route.
                Using this style of reporting, you can run simulations to determine where the
                document will go in future route nodes. For example, to run a simulation against an
                existing document to determine to whom it will route in the future, execute this
                code:</para>
            <sect3>
                <title>Routing Report against a Document</title>
                <programlisting>WorkflowInfo info = new WorkflowInfo();
RoutingReportCriteriaVO criteria = new ReportCriteriaVO(new Long(1234));
DocumentDetailVO results = info.routingReport(criteria);
// examine results...
</programlisting>
                <para>This runs a report against the document with ID 1234, starting at the active
                    nodes of the document and continuing to the terminal nodes of the document. The
                    DocumentDetailVO will contain the Action Requests generated during the report
                    simulation.</para>
                <para>You can also stop the report at a particular node or once Rice generates a
                    request for a particular user. For example, to stop the report simulation at a
                    node or when Rice generates a certain user's request, configure the report
                    criteria like this:</para>
            </sect3>
            <sect3>
                <title>Terminate Report at Node or User</title>
                <programlisting>WorkflowInfo info = new WorkflowInfo();

RoutingReportCriteriaVO criteria = new ReportCriteriaVO(new Long(1234), "MyNodeName");
criteria.setTargetUsers(new UserIdVO[] { new NetworkIdVO("ewestfal") });

DocumentDetailVO results = info.routingReport(criteria);
</programlisting>
                <para>This executes the report until it reaches a node named <emphasis role="bold"
                        >MyNodeName</emphasis> or a request is generated for user <emphasis
                        role="bold">ewestfal</emphasis>.</para>
                <para>In the second style of reporting, the report is run against an arbitrary
                    Document Type and the simulation engine creates a temporary document against
                    which to run the report. When setting up the report criteria for these
                    scenarios, you usually populate the XML content of the document on the criteria
                    (provided that the routing of that document evaluates the XML). Also, the
                    criteria need to be configured with the valid node names (or rule templates)
                    against which the report should be run. For example, to run a Document Type
                    report, you can invoke the routing report this way:</para>
            </sect3>
            <sect3>
                <title>Report against a Document Type</title>
                <programlisting>WorkflowInfo info = new WorkflowInfo();
RouteReportCriteriaVO criteria = new ReportCriteriaVO("MyDocumentType");

criteria.setXmlContent("&lt;accountNumber>1234&lt;/accountNumber>");

criteria.setNodeNames(new String[] { "MyNodeName" });
DocumentDetailVO results = info.routingReport(criteria);
</programlisting>
                <para>The code above simulates the generation of requests for <emphasis role="bold"
                        >MyDocumentType</emphasis> at the <emphasis role="bold"
                        >MyNodeName</emphasis> node with the XML given. This sort of reporting is
                    especially useful if you simply need to determine what rules in the rule system
                    will fire and generate action requests under a particular scenario.</para>
                <para>As an alternative to specifying the node names, you can also specify rule
                    template names. This is simply another way to target a specific node in the
                    document. It searches the Document Type definition for nodes with the specified
                    rule templates and then runs the report against those nodes. Currently, the rule
                    template must exist on a node in the Document Type definition or an error will
                    be thrown. In the case of our previous example, you could simply change the line
                    that sets the node names on the criteria to:</para>
                <programlisting>criteria.setRuleTemplateNames(new String[] { "MyRuleTemplate" });</programlisting>
                <para>As above, this is primarily useful for determining who will have requests
                    generated to them from the KEW rule system.</para>

            <title>Interpreting Report Results</title>
            <para>As we've seen, the object returned by the Routing Report is an instance of
                DocumentDetailVO. This object extends RouteHeaderVO and provides three more pieces
                of data along with it:<orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>An array of ActionRequestVO objects representing the action requests
                            on the document </para>

                </orderedlist></para>
            <para>For reporting, the most important piece of data here is typically the
                ActionRequestVO objects. After running a report, this array contains the Action
                Requests that were generated as the result of the simulation. So, for example, in
                the example above where we run a document type report against the <emphasis
                    role="bold">MyRuleTemplate</emphasis> rule template, this array contains all of
                the Action Requests that were generated to users or workgroups during the report
                simulation.</para>

            <title>Application Plugin</title>
            <para>Use an application plugin to deploy an application area's routing components into
                Workflow. These routing components might include:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Rule attributes </para>

                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>If these components require access to a data source, then the application plugin
                also configures the data source and allows it to participate in Workflow's JTA
                transactions. </para>
            <para>In addition to routing components, the application plugin can also configure a
                plugin listener and a Resource Loader. The Resource Loader is responsible for
                loading resources (both Java classes and service implementations) from the plugin
                and providing them to the core system.</para>
            <para>Application plugins are hot-deployable, so a restart of the server is not required
                when they are added or modified. The core system searches for plugins in a directory
                configured in the application configuration (see KEW Module Configuration).</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Plugin Layout</title>
            <para>You build the plugin as a set of files and directories. You then zip this
                structure and place it in the appropriate Workflow plugin space. For application
                plugins, this directory location is defined in the core system configuration.</para>
            <para>The name of the zip file (minus the .zip extension) is used as the name of the
                plugin. The Plugin Loader only looks for files that end in .zip when determining
                whether to load and hot-deploy a plugin.</para>
            <para>In general, application plugins can be named as desired. However, there is one
                reserved plugin name:</para>
            <para>
                <emphasis role="bold">shared</emphasis> - A special plugin that provides a shared
                classloading space to all plugins (see Plugin Shared Space). </para>
            <para>The directory structure of a plugin is similar to that of a web application. It
                should have this structure:</para>
            <programlisting>classes/

lib/
META-INF/

            <para>Application plugins usually provide a subset of the functionality that an
                institutional plugin provides, since the institutional plugin can provide core
                service overrides.</para>
            <para>The plugin framework provides two configuration points:<orderedlist>

                <title>Plugin XML Configuration</title>
                <para>The XML configuration is defined in a file called workflow.xml. The format of
                    this file is relatively simple. An example workflow.xml file:</para>

    &lt;param name="my.param.2">123&lt;/param>

                <title>Plugin Parameters</title>
                <para>The parameter configuration uses XML as the syntax. These parameters are
                    placed into a configuration context for the plugin. The configuration inherits
                    (and can override) values from the parent configurations. The configuration
                    hierarchy is core -> institutional plugin -> application plugins.</para>

                    <title>Resource Loader</title>
                    <para>A plugin can define an instance of <emphasis role="bold"
                            >org.kuali.rice.resourceloader.ResourceLoader</emphasis> to handle the
                        loading of classes and services. When KEW attempts to load classes or locate
                        services, it searches the institutional plugin, then the core, then any
                        application plugins. It does this by invoking the <emphasis role="bold"
                            >getObject(..)</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"
                            >getService(...)</emphasis> methods on the plugin's

                    <title>Configuring an Extra Classpath</title>
                    <para>Sometimes it is desirable to be able to point in a plugin to classes or
                        library directories outside of the plugin space. This can be particularly
                        useful in development environments, where the plugin uses many of the same
                        classes as the main application that is integrating with Workflow. In these
                        scenarios, configuring an extra Classpath may mean you don’t need to jar or
                        copy many common class files.</para>
                    <para>To do this, specify these properties in your plugin's <emphasis

                            >lib</emphasis> directories. The classloader always looks in the default
                        locations first, and then defers to the extra classpath if it cannot locate
                        the class or resource.</para>

                <programlisting>&lt;bean id="userTransaction" class="org.kuali.rice.jta.UserTransactionFactoryBean" />

&lt;bean id="jtaTransactionManager" class="org.kuali.rice.jta.TransactionManagerFactoryBean" />

&lt;bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager">
    &lt;property name="userTransaction" ref="userTransaction" />
    &lt;property name="transactionManager" ref="jtaTransactionManager" />
    &lt;property name="defaultTimeout" value="${transaction.timeout}"/>
&lt;/bean></programlisting>
                <para>The factory beans in the above XML will locate the <emphasis role="bold"
                        >javax.trasaction.UserTransaction</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"
                        >java.transaction.TransactionManager</emphasis>, which are configured in the
                    core system. These can then be referenced and injected into other beans (such as
                    the Spring JtaTransactionManager).</para>
                <para>Once you configure the transaction manager, you also need to configure any
                    DataSources you require. Here's an example of configuring a DataSource that
                    participates in Atomikos JTA transactions (the default Transaction Manager
                    distributed with Rice Standalone).</para>
                <programlisting>&lt;bean id="myDataSource" class="com.atomikos.jdbc.nonxa.NonXADataSourceBean">
    &lt;property name="uniqueResourceName" value="myDataSource"/>
    &lt;property name="driverClassName" value="..."/>
    &lt;property name="url" value="..."/>  
    ...
&lt;/bean></programlisting>
                <para>So, the application can access it's datasource by either injecting it into
                    Spring services or by fetching it directly from the Spring context. </para>
                <para>You can find more information on configuring Rice DataSources and
                    TransactionManagers in Datasource and JTA Configuration.</para>

            <title>OJB Configuration within a Plugin</title>
            <para>If your plugin needs to use OJB, there are a few other configuration steps that
                you need to take. First, in your Spring file, add the following line to allow Spring
                to locate OJB and the JTA Transaction Manager:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;bean id="ojbConfigurer" class="org.kuali.rice.ojb.JtaOjbConfigurer">
    &lt;property name="transactionManager" ref="jtaTransactionManager" />

&lt;/bean>
</programlisting>
            <para>Next, for OJB to plug into Workflow's JTA transactions, you need to modify some
                settings in the plugin's <emphasis role="bold">OJB.properties</emphasis> file (or
                the equivalent):</para>
            <programlisting>PersistenceBrokerFactoryClass=org.apache.ojb.broker.core.PersistenceBrokerFactorySyncImpl
ImplementationClass=org.apache.ojb.odmg.ImplementationJTAImpl
OJBTxManagerClass=org.apache.ojb.odmg.JTATxManager
ConnectionFactoryClass=org.kuali.rice.ojb.RiceDataSourceConnectionFactory
JTATransactionManagerClass=org.kuali.rice.ojb.TransactionManagerFactory
</programlisting>
            <para>The first three properties listed are part of the standard setup for using JTA
                with OJB. However, there are custom Rice implementations:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><emphasis role="bold"

                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>This OJB ConnectionFactory searches your Spring Context for a bean with the same
                name as your <emphasis role="bold">jcd-alias</emphasis>. Here is what an OJB
                connection descriptor might look like inside of a Workflow plugin:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;jdbc-connection-descriptor
    jcd-alias="myDataSource"
    default-connection="true"
    platform="Oracle9i"
    jdbc-level="3.0"
    eager-release="false"
    batch-mode="false"
    useAutoCommit="0"
    ignoreAutoCommitExceptions="false">
    
    &lt;sequence-manager className="org.apache.ojb.broker.util.sequence.SequenceManagerNextValImpl" />
    &lt;object-cache class="org.apache.ojb.broker.cache.ObjectCachePerBrokerImpl"/>
&lt;/jdbc-connection-descriptor>
</programlisting>
            <para>Notice that the <emphasis role="bold">jcd-alias</emphasis> attribute matches the
                name of the DataSource Spring bean defined in the example above.</para>
            <para>Another important thing to notice in this configuration is that <emphasis
                    role="bold">useAutoCommit</emphasis> is set to 0. This tells OJB not to change
                the auto commit status of the connection because it is being managed by JTA.</para>
            <para>Finally, when your plugin needs to use OJB, you need to use this:</para>
            <programlisting>org.kuali.rice.ojb.TransactionManagerFactory</programlisting>
            <para>This provides OJB with the <emphasis role="bold"
                    >javax.transaction.TransactionManager</emphasis> that was injected into your
                JtaOjbConfigurer, as in the example above.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Overriding Services with a ResourceLoader</title>
            <para>For a service override, you need to define a custom ResourceLoader implementation
                and configure it in your workflow.xml plugin configuration file. The
                org.kuali.rice.resourceloader.ResourceLoader interface defines this relative
                method:</para>
            <programlisting>public Object getService(javax.xml.namespace.QName qname);</programlisting>
            <para>When KEW is searching for services, it invokes this method on its plugins'
                ResourceLoader implementations. The service name is a qualified name (as indicated
                by the use of <emphasis role="bold">javax.xml.namespace.QName</emphasis>), but for
                services being located from the core, service names typically contain only a local
                part and no namespace.</para>
            <para>The easiest way to implement a custom ResourceLoader is to create a class that
                extends from <emphasis role="bold"
                    >org.kuali.rice.resourceloader.BaseResourceLoader</emphasis> and just override
                the <emphasis role="bold">getService(QName)</emphasis> method. The
                BaseResourceLoader provides standard functionality for loading objects from
                ClassLoaders, among other things.</para>
            <para>For example, if you want to override the User Service, you might implement this
                ResourceLoader:</para>
            <programlisting>public class MyResourceLoader extends BaseResourceLoader {
    public MyResourceLoader() {
        super(new QName("MyResourceLoader"));
	
    }

    @Override
    public Object getService(QName serviceName) {
        if ("enUserOptionsService".equals(serviceName.getLocalPart()) {
            // return your custom implementation of org.kuali.rice.kew.useroptions.UserOptionsService
        } else if (...) {
            ...
        } else if (...) {
            ...
        }
        return super.getService(serviceName);
    }
}
</programlisting>
            <para>In the next section, we'll look at some of the services commonly overridden in an
                institutional plugin</para>

                        >org/kuali/workflow/resources/KewSpringBeans.xml</emphasis> file in the
                    Institutional Plugin. What follows is a list of the most commonly overridden

                    <title>User Service</title>
                    <para>The Workflow core uses the UserService to resolve and search for users.
                        The UserService could be as simple as a static set of users or as complex
                        and integrated as a university-wide user system. Your institution may choose
                        how to implement this, as long as you provide capabilities for the ID types
                        that you intend to use. At the very least, implementations are required for
                        the <emphasis role="bold">WorkflowUserId</emphasis> and <emphasis
                            role="bold">AuthenticationUserId</emphasis> types (and their
                        corresponding VO beans). All of the UserId types must be unique across the
                        entire set of users. </para>
                    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">WorkflowUserId</emphasis> is typically
                        associated with a unique numerical sequence value and the <emphasis
                            role="bold">AuthenticationUserId</emphasis> is typically the username or
                        network ID of the user.</para>
                    <para>The default UserService implementation provides a persistent user store
                        that allows you to create and edit users through the GUI. It also caches
                        users for improved performance and implements an XML import for mass user
                        import. Institutions usually override the default user service with an
                        implementation that integrates with their own user repository.</para>

                    and since the plugin needs its own copy of these libraries, it needs to ensure

            <title>General Usage</title>
            <para>The Kuali Enterprise Workflow engine makes use of both synchronous service
                endpoints and asynchronous messaging features from the Kuali Service Bus.</para>
            <para>Most asynchronous processing that KEW does is implemented using asynchronous
                messaging on the service bus. This includes:<orderedlist>

                        </para>

                        <para>Re-resolving actions requests resulting from a responsibility change
                        </para>

                    <listitem>

                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist></para>
            <para>In each of these cases, there exists a service that processes asynchronous
                messages and performs the appropriate actions for each of these functions.</para>
            <para>In terms of synchronous services, Kuali Enterprise Workflow publishes two
                different types of services. One is used for performing workflow document actions
                (such as creating, approving, disapproving, etc.). The other is used to perform
                various query or read-only operations against the workflow system.</para>

            <title>Implications of using “Synchronous” KSB messaging with KEW</title>
            <para>For general information on synchronous messaging and its implications in the KSB,
                please read “Implications of synchronous vs. asynchronous Message Deliver” in the
                KSB technical reference guide.</para>
            <para>In terms of Kuali Enterprise Workflow, the usage of synchronous messing means that
                operations like workflow engine processing will happen immediately and synchronously
                at the time it’s invoked.</para>
            <para>The main implication here besides what is listed in the KSB documentation is that,
                since message exception handling isn’t implemented, exception routing does not work
                when using synchronous KSB messaging.</para>
            <para>This means that if this messaging model is being used in a batch job, or similar
                type of program, routing exceptions will need to be manually caught. If it’s desired
                to place a document into exception status from here, there are methods on the KEW
                APIs to do this manually.</para>
