@cmp{Demo-LinkFieldView}#description=\
  The Link and Link Field components are used to generate the HTML a (link) tag.\
  The a tag is used to link to another document (the primary mechanism of navigation in the web). \
  The link is presented to use by a label, which when clicked on will take the user to the linked page.
  \
  To create a link component we create a bean with parent of �Uif-Link�. \
  We configure the linked source using the hrefText property. As is the case for all URL resources, \
  we can specify a relative or full URL. The label for the link (what the user will see) \
  is given by the linkLabel property.
