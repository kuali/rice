@cmp{Demo-CollectionEditLine-Example1}#instructionalText=This demo shows the default behavior of a collection's \
  edit line in dialog without custom edit line items nor custom actions. In this case, the edit line dialog items \
  default to the items in the collection group (in this example, the fields are 'field1' and 'field2'), and the \
  actions default to their respective prototypes. There are 2 default actions, the edit line in dialog line action, \
  which displays the edit line dialog with the current line items to edit, and the other is the save changes action, \
  which is displayed in the edit line dialog to save the changes made to the current line by invoking the \
  controller's saveLine method.
