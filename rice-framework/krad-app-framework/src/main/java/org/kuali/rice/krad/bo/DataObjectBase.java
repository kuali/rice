/**
 * Declares an optional superclass for classes which can have their
 * state persisted.  A data object which is persistable defines some additional methods
 * which allow for various operations to be executed that relate to the persistent nature of
 * the data object.  A persistable data object also has some additional data
 * attributes which include the version number, the object id, and the extension.
 *
 * <p>The version number indicates the version of the data object when it was retrieved
 * from persistent storage.  This allows for services to check this version number
 * during persistence operations to prevent silent overwrites of data object state.
 * These kinds of scenarios might arise as a result of concurrent modification to the data
 * object in the persistent store (i.e. two web application users updating the same record
 * in a database).  The kind of check which would be performed using the version number is commonly
 * referred to as "optimistic locking".
 *
 * <p>The object id represents a globally unique identifier for the business object.  In practice,
 * this can be used by other portions of the system to link to data objects which
 * might be stored in different locations or even different persistent data stores.  In general, it
 * is not the responsibility of the client who implements a persistable data object to handle
 * generating this value.  The framework will handle this automatically at the point in time when
 * the data object is persisted.  If the client does need to do this themselves, however, care
 * should be taken that an appropriate globally unique value generator algorithm is used
 * (such as the one provided by {@link UUID}).
 *
 * <p>The extension object is primarily provided for the purposes of allowing implementer
 * customization of the data object without requiring the original data object to be
 * modified.  The additional extension object which is linked with the
 * parent data object via use of {@link org.kuali.rice.krad.data.provider.annotation.ExtensionFor}
 * annotation on the actual extension class} can contain additional data attributes and methods.
 * The framework will automatically request that this extension object be persisted when the parent
 * data object is persisted.  This is generally the most useful in cases where an application is defining
 * data objects that will be used in redistributable software packages (such as the
 * actual Kuali Foundation projects themselves).  If using the framework for the purposes
 * of implementing an internal application, the use of a data object extensions
 * is likely unnecessary.
