 * Represents an entity which can be modified.  A Modifiable records it's state when

 * isModified() should return false.  If this state changes in a way which makes this 
 * Modifiable "dirty" then subsequent calls to isModified() should return true.
 * 
 * <p>It is up to the implementor of the Modifiable to determine the contract between
 * the Modifiable and the entities interested in it's modified status.  This could
 * include interested entities taking action on the Modifiable once it has become
 * modified which result in it's modified status being reset.  Another possibility is
 * for a Modifiable to be discarded once it has been modified.
