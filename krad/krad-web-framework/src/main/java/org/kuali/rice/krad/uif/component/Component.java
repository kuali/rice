 * All classes of the UIF that are used as a rendering element implement the

 * following structure:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Dictionary Configuration/Composition</li>
 * <li>Java Class (the Component implementation</li>
 * <li>>JSP Template Renderer</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three basic types of components:

 * <li>Container Components: <code>View</code>, <code>Group</code></li>
 * <li>Field Components: <code>Field</code></li>
 * <li>Widget Components: <code>Widget</code></li>
