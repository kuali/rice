/**
 * Interface for classes that act as a business object within the framework
 *
 * <p>
 * Business objects are special objects to the Rice framework that indicate an object has certain features
 * (like refresh). Most business objects are persistable, see @{link PersistableBusinessObject},
 * which means Rice can provide handle the CRUD operations performed on the object. In addition, metadata from the
 * ORM layer will be available on these objects that is consumed by the framework to enable features.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Business objects are a special kind of data object within the system. A data object is just a general object that
 * provides data within the system and can be used to back the user interfaces. In general, how the system doesn't
 * know anything about how data objects are built (for example they could come from services or some other mechanism).
 * Make a data object implement BusinessObject causes the system to make assumptions regarding the handling of that
 * object.
