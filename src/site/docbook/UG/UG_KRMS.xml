            <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Kuali's Rule Management System (KRMS)
                supports the creation, maintenance, storage and retrieval of business rules and
                agendas (ordered sets of business rules) within business contexts (e.g., for a
                particular department or for a particular university-wide process). It allows
                applications to externalize business logic that commonly needs customization, and
                empowers business analysts to modify them to reflect changes in policy. </para>
            <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KRMS enables you to define a set of
                rules within a particular business unit or for a particular set of applications.
                These business rules define logical conditions and the set of actions that result
                when those conditions are met. KRMS enables you to call and use this logic from any
                application, without having to re-write and manage all the rules' maintenance logic
                within the application. </para>

            <para>Previously if a newly hired employee met a set of criteria, they would need to have an 
                eVerify check ran in addition to the standard I-9 process. The initial requirement stated that
                if the original hire date of an employee is greater that August 1, 2006, the grant is of a 
                Government type, the grant amount is greater than $5,000, the grant is longer than 2 months, 
                and the employee has not previously completed an eVerify check then their hire document needs 
                to be routed to the special HR eVerify workgroup.</para>

                        is a single expression of logic that returns true or false. Propositions can
                        be compounded, created using AND, OR, or both to create more complex logic.
                        The entire IF statement in the example above comprises a compound
                        proposition.</para></listitem>

            <title>KRMS Agenda Editor</title>
            <para>Rules in KRMS are placed into ordered sets called Agendas. The order of the Rules
                in an Agenda determines the sequencing: which rule gets evaluated first, second and
                so on. The Agenda also enables you to include conditional branching logic between
                Rules. </para>
            <para>In turn, Agendas are are created in Contexts, which may represent any categories
                that are relevant within your institution. For example, they could correspond to
                document types or business processes or any other categories. In some university
                environments, the following might be relevant contexts: Awards, Proposals, IRB
                reviews, Course co-requisites, Course pre-requisites, Student plan evaluations, and
                so on. </para>
            <para>Each Context contains its own agendas, and each Agenda contains its own rules.
                Rules aren't shared across agendas (though you can copy/paste, they become unique
                Rule instances), and Agendas aren't shared across Contexts. There is no Context
                hierarchy, that is, Agendas and Rules can't be inherited across contexts within any
                sort of hierarchy. </para>
