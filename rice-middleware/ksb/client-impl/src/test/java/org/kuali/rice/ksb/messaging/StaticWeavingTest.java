 * This test verifies that all of the JPA objects in this module are statically weaved.
 *
 * <p>If one executes this test from within an IDE environment, it very well may not pass if one of the JPA objects
 * under examination was modified and then recompiled by the IDE. The static weaving process is handled by Maven,
 * so without executing the appropriate Maven lifecycle phase, the class will not get weaved. Regardless, this test
 * should *always* pass when executed from the command line.</p>
