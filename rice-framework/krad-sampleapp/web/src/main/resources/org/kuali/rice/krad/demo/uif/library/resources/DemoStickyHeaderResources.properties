@cmp{Demo-StickyHeaderView}#description=\
  Sticky header options allow you to make various parts of the View's header (and surrounding content) stay in place. \
  The pattern (not sticky)-(sticky)-(not sticky)-(sticky) is NOT ALLOWED; ie, two independent areas that "scroll \
  collapse" are not allowed. Keep in \
  mind that sticky content must have a solid background color/pattern and a width of 100% to appear correct to the user.
