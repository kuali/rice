/**
 * A service which facilitates remote operations against a cache which is deployed using Kuali Rice's core caching
 * infrastructure.  The only operation currently supported by this service allows for flushing of cache entries based on
 * a specified collection of {@link CacheTarget} objects.  These cache targets specify information about which cache
 * entries should be flushed.
 *
 * <p>This service exists primarily to support client-side caching of data provided by remote services.  It allows the
 * host of the service to notify the client application about flush events, which typically result whenever changes
 * have been made to data such that it would be stale if cached within the client.</p>
