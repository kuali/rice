/**
 * Defines the interface for a remotely accessible service registry.  Applications
 * can query for information about available services through the apis provided
 * as well as publishing their own services.
 * 
 * <p>The {@code ServiceRegistry} deals primarily with the concept of a
 * {@link ServiceEndpoint} which holds a {@link ServiceInfo}
 * and a {@link ServiceDescriptor}.  These pieces include information about the
 * service and it's configuration which might be needed by applications wishing to
 * invoke those services.
 * 
 * <p>Many of the operations on the {@code ServiceRegistry} only return the 
 * {@code ServiceInfo}.  This is because retrieving the full {@code ServiceDescriptor}
 * is a more expensive operation (since it consists of a serialized XML
 * representation of the service's configuration which needs to be unmarshaled
 * and processed) and typically the descriptor is only needed when the client
 * application actually wants to connect to the service.
 * 
 * <p>The {@link ServiceInfo} provides two important pieces of information which
 * help the registry (and the applications which interact with it) understand
 * who the owner of a service is.  The first of these is the "application id"
 * which identifies the application which owns the service.  In terms of
 * Kuali Rice, an "application" is an abstract concept and consist of multiple
 * instances of an application which are essentially mirrors of each other and
 * publish the same set of services.  Each of these individuals instances of
 * an application is identified by the "instance id" which is also available
 * from the {@code ServiceInfo}.
