/**
 * 
 * This service acts as a facade on the entity information that is provided
 * through the IdentityService and provides a "person-centric" view of that 
 * entity data.
 * 
 * <p>In general, the Person object flattens out the various related pieces of
 * entity data into a denormalized view on that data.  In many cases, that
 * data will have a defined "default" value in the entity data model.  This
 * default data is what the Person object will be constructed with.  For
 * example, an entity can have more than one name, but one of those names
 * is flagged as the default.
 * 
 * <p>This service will do it's best to construct valid Person objects even
 * for entities that don't have an entity type of "PERSON".  In those cases
 * not all of the attributes on the Person object will be populated.
