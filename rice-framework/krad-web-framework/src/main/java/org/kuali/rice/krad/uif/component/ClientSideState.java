/**
 * Annotation that can be used on <code>Component</code> properties to indicate the property
 * value should be exposed in the client and populated back from the client
 *
 * <p>
 * Some components have state that can be altered on the client without making a server call. An
 * example of this is the open state for an <code>Disclosure</code>. When the View is refreshed
 * from the server, the refreshed state needs to reflect the last state before the refresh was made. The
 * framework supports this exposure of state in the client and syncing of the client state to the server
 * component by means of this annotation.
 *
 * During the finalize phase, values for properties that contain this annotation will be pulled and added
 * to the ViewState object that is exposed through JavaScript. The property name/value pair is associated
 * with the component id on the ViewState object so that the state can be updated when the view is refreshed.
 *
 * Properties exposed client side can also be accessed and updated by custom script.
 * e.g.
 * var componentState = ViewState['componentId']; // or ViewState.componentId
 * var propertyValue = componentState['propertyName'];
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The property will be exposed client side with the identifier given by {@link #variableName()}. If not specified,
 * the name of the property for which the annotation applies will be used
 * </p>
