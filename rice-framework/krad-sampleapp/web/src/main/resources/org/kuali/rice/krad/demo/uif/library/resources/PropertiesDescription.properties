org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.AnyCharacterPatternConstraint|omitNewline|boolean=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint=A class that implements the required accessor for label keys. This provides a convenient base class\n from which other constraints can be derived.\n\n Only BaseConstraints can have state validation.\n\n This class is a direct copy of one that was in Kuali Student.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|applyClientSide|Boolean=If this is true, the constraint should be applied on the client side when the user interacts with\n a field - if this constraint can be interpreted for client side use. Default is true.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|constraintStateOverrides|List=Get the list of constraintStateOverrides which represent constraints that will replace THIS constraint\n when their state is matched during validation.\n Because of this, constraints added to this list MUST have their states defined.\n\n <p>ConstraintStateOverrides always take precedence over this\n constraint if they apply to the state being evaluated during validation.  These settings have no effect if\n there is no stateMapping represented on the entry/view being evaluated.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|messageComponentCode|String=A code within the namespace that identifies a component or group the constraint message is associated with\n\n <p>\n Used with the namespace and error key for retrieving the constraint text. If null,\n the default component code will be used\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|messageKey|String=A key that is used to retrieve the constraint message text (used with the namespace and component\n code if specified)
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|messageNamespaceCode|String=Namespace code (often an application or module code) the constraint failure message is associated with\n\n <p>\n Used with the component code and error key for retrieving the constraint. If null,\n the default namespace code will be used\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|states|List=A list of states to apply this constraint for, this will effect when a constraint\n is applied.\n\n <p>Each state this constraint is applied for needs to be declared with few additional options\:\n <ul>\n <li>if NO states are defined for this constraint, this constraint is applied for ALL states</li>\n <li>if a state is defined with a + symbol, example "state+", then this constraint will be applied for that state\n and ALL following states</li>\n <li>if a state is defined as a range with ">", example "state1>state6", then this constraint will be applied for\n all\n states from state1 to state6 </li>\n </ul>\n These can be mixed and matched, as appropriate, though states using a + symbol should always be the last\n item of a list (as they imply this state and everything else after).</p>\n\n <p>Example state list may be\: ["state1", "state3>state5", "state6+"].  In this example, note that this\n constraint\n is never applied to "state2" (assuming these example states represent a state order by number)</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|validationMessageParams|List=Parameters to be used in the string retrieved by this constraint's messageKey, ordered by number of\n the param
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint=CaseConstraint is imposed only when a certain condition is met\n\n <p>For example, if the country attribute value is "USA",\n then a prerequisite constraint may be imposed that the 'State' attribute is non-null.</p>\n\n <p>\n This class is a direct copy of one that was in Kuali Student.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint|caseSensitive|boolean=checks whether string comparison will be carried out in a case sensitive fashion
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint|operator|String=specifies the kind of relationship to be checked between the actual value and the ones defined in the {@link\n \#getWhenConstraint()}
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint|propertyName|String=gets the property name for the attribute to which the case constraint is applied to

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CharsetPatternConstraint=Pattern for matching any character in the given list (String)
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CharsetPatternConstraint|validChars|String=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ConfigurationBasedRegexPatternConstraint=ConfigurationBasedRegexPatternConstraint uses a patternTypeKey to get the regex used for validation by key from\n the KualiConfigurationService
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ConfigurationBasedRegexPatternConstraint|patternTypeKey|String=Message key used to identify the validation pattern
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.DatePatternConstraint=DatePatternConstraint constrains a field to only allow dates which are part of the formats\n defined in the system. Constraining a field all these formats is often not appropriate for\n fields, and you may want to constrain the input to a subset of the allowed formats in the system.\n This can be done by setting the allowed formats to this subset (see BasicDatePatternConstraint\n bean for example)
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.DatePatternConstraint|allowedFormats|List=

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.MustOccurConstraint=Must occur constraints are constraints that indicate some range of acceptable valid results. So a must occur\n constraint\n might indicate that between 1 and 3 prequisite constraints must be valid. For example, on a person object, it might\n be\n that one of three fields must be filled in\:\n\n 1. username\n 2. email\n 3. phone number\n\n By imposing a must occur constraint on the person object iself, and setting three prequisite constraints below it,\n with a min of 1\n and a max of 3, this requirement can be enforced.\n\n A more complicated example might be that a US address is only valid if it provides either\:\n (a) a city and state, or\n (b) a postal code\n\n To enforce this, a single must occur constraint would have two children\: (1) a prequisite constraint on postal code,\n and (2) a must occur constraint\n with two child prequisite constraints, on city and state, respectively. By setting min\=1/max\=2 at the top must occur\n constraint,\n and min\=2/max\=2 at the leaf constraint, this requirement can be enforced.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.MustOccurConstraint|max|Integer=

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.NumericPatternConstraint=Pattern for matching numeric characters, difference between NumericPatternConstraint and IntegerPatternConstraint\n is that a numeric pattern constraint is for matching numeric characters and can be mixed with other characters\n by setting allow flags on, while integer is for only positive/negative numbers
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.PrerequisiteConstraint=Prerequisite constraints require that some other attribute be non-empty in order for the constraint to be valid.\n So, a 7-digit US phone number might have a prerequisite of an area code, or an address street2 might have a\n prerequisite\n that street1 is non-empty.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.PrerequisiteConstraint|propertyName|String=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint=A simple constraint stores 'basic' constraints for a field.  This constraint is meant to be used as a\n constraint for WhenConstraints in CaseConstraint, and is also used internally in InputField.

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint|minLength|Integer=The minimum amount of characters this field's value has to be
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint|minOccurs|Integer=The minimum amount of items in this fields list of values - not yet used/do not use
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint|required|Boolean=If true the field is required
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.UTF8AnyCharacterPatternConstraint=Pattern for matching any printable character
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.UTF8AnyCharacterPatternConstraint|allowWhitespace|boolean=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.UTF8AnyCharacterPatternConstraint|omitNewline|boolean=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersConstraint=This is a constraint that limits attribute values to some subset of valid characters or to match a particular\n regular\n expression.\n\n For example\:\n - To limit to both upper and lower-case letters, value can be set to "[A-Za-z]*"\n - To limit to any character except carriage returns and line feeds, value can be set to "[^\\n\\r]*"
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersConstraint|value|String=The Java based regex for valid characters\n This value should include the ^ and $ symbols if needed
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersPatternConstraint=This abstract class extends from ValidCharactersConstraint. Its subclasses contain a regex that\n is built out with flags that can be turned off and on. All ValidCharactersPatternConstraints\n allow a certain set of characters to be repeated multiple times
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersPatternConstraint|value|String=The Java based regex for valid characters\n This value should include the ^ and $ symbols if needed
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidDataPatternConstraint=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidDataPatternConstraint|value|String=The Java based regex for valid characters\n This value should include the ^ and $ symbols if needed
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint={@code WhenConstraint} is a child of a {@link CaseConstraint}\n\n <p>It provides a specific additional constraint that should be processed when\n the condition itself is true.</p>\n\n <p>So a case constraint on country, might have a when constraint with value\='USA', and another with value\='Canada'.\n Each of these\n {@code WhenConstraint}'s would define a constraint of their own that would only be processed when the country was\n USA, or when the country\n was Canada.</p>\n\n <p>A {@code WhenConstraint} either specifies an attribute path whose value it then provides or a constraint.\n The parent @{CaseConstraint} is defined on the field on which the constraints are desired to take effect.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint|constraint|Constraint=The constraint to apply to the field when the {@code WhenConstraint} value/values match
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint|valuePath|String=Path that can retrieve an attributes value
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint|values|List=List of values to check for this constraint
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo=Provides binding configuration for an DataBinding component (attribute or\n collection)\n\n <p>\n From the binding configuration the binding path is determined (if not\n manually set) and used to set the path in the UI or to get the value from the\n model\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindByNamePrefix|String=Prefix that will be used to form the binding path from the component\n name. Typically used for nested collection properties
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindToForm|boolean=Indicates whether the component binds directly to the form (that is its\n bindingName gives a property available through the form), or whether is\n binds through a nested form object. If bindToForm is false, it is assumed\n the component binds to the object given by the form property whose path\n is configured by bindingObjectPath.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindToMap|boolean=Indicates whether the parent object for the property that we are binding\n to is a Map. If true the binding path will be adjusted to use the map key\n syntax
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindingName|String=Gives the name of the property that the component binds to. The name can\n be nested but not the full path, just from the parent object or in the\n case of binding directly to the form from the form object\n\n <p>\n If blank this will be set from the name field of the component\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindingObjectPath|String=For attribute fields that do not belong to the default form object (given\n by the view), this field specifies the path to the object (on the form)\n the attribute does belong to.\n\n <p>\n e.g. Say we have an attribute field with property name 'number', that\n belongs to the object given by the 'account' property on the form. The\n form object path would therefore be set to 'account'. If the property\n belonged to the object given by the 'document.header' property of the\n form, the binding object path would be set to 'document.header'. Note if\n the binding object path is not set for an attribute field (or any\n <code>DataBinding</code> component), the binding object path configured\n on the <code>View</code> will be used (unless bindToForm is set to true,\n where is assumed the property is directly available from the form).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindingPath|String=Path to the property on the model the component binds to. Uses standard\n dot notation for nested properties. If the binding path was manually set\n it will be returned as it is, otherwise the path will be formed by using\n the binding object path and the bind prefix\n\n <p>\n e.g. Property name 'foo' on a model would have binding path "foo", while\n property name 'name' of the nested model property 'account' would have\n binding path "account.name"\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase=Base implementation of <code>Component</code> which other component implementations should extend\n \n <p>\n Provides base component properties such as id and template. Also provides default implementation\n for the <code>ScriptEventSupport</code> and <code>Ordered</code> interfaces. By default no script\n events except the onDocumentReady are supported.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|additionalComponentsToRefresh|List=Returns a list of componentIds which will be also be refreshed when this component is refreshed\n\n <p>\n This will be a comma separated list of componentIds that need to be refreshed when a refresh\n condition has been set on this component.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|additionalCssClasses|List=Convenience property for adding css class names to the end of the list of cssClasses that may already exist on\n this Component (this is to avoid explicitly having to set list merge in the bean definition)
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|align|String=Horizontal alignment of the component within its container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a <code>Container</code> and are placed using a\n <code>LayoutManager</code>. This property specifies how the component\n should be aligned horizontally within the container. During the finalize\n phase the CSS text-align style will be created for the align setting.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|colSpan|int=Number of places the component should take up horizontally in the\n container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a {@code Container} and are placed using a\n {@code LayoutManager}. This property specifies how many places\n horizontally the component should take up within the container. This is\n only applicable for table based layout managers. Default is 1\n </p>\n\n TODO\: this should not be on component interface since it only applies if\n the layout manager supports it, need some sort of layoutOptions map for\n field level options that depend on the manager
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|componentModifiers|List={@code ComponentModifier} instances that should be invoked to\n initialize the component\n\n <p>\n These provide dynamic initialization behavior for the component and are\n configured through the components definition. Each initializer will get\n invoked by the initialize method.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|componentSecurity|ComponentSecurity=Security object that indicates what authorization (permissions) exist for the component
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|conditionalRefresh|String=When set if the condition is satisfied, the component will be refreshed.\n \n <p>\n The component MUST BE a container or field type. conditionalRefresh is defined in a limited\n Spring EL syntax. Only valid form property names, and, or, logical comparison operators\n (non-arithmetic), \#listContains, \#emptyList, and the matches clause are allowed. String and\n regex values must use single quotes ('), booleans must be either true or false, numbers must\n be a valid double either negative or positive.\n \n <p>\n DO NOT use progressiveRender and conditionalRefresh on the same component unless it is known\n that the component will always be visible in all cases when a conditionalRefresh happens (ie\n conditionalRefresh has progressiveRender's condition anded with its own condition). <b>If a\n component should be refreshed every time it is shown, use the progressiveRenderAndRefresh\n option with this property instead.</b>\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|context|Map=Context map for the component\n\n <p>\n Any el statements configured for the components properties (e.g.\n title\="@{foo.property}") are evaluated using the el context map. This map\n will get populated with default objects like the model, view, and request\n from the {@code ViewHelperService}. Other components can push\n further objects into the context so that they are available for use with\n that component. For example, {@code Field} instances that are part\n of a collection line as receive the current line instance\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Context map also provides objects to methods that are invoked for\n {@code GeneratedField} instances\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The Map key gives the name of the variable that can be used within\n expressions, and the Map value gives the object instance for which\n expressions containing the variable should evaluate against\n </p>\n\n <p>\n NOTE\: Calling getContext().putAll() will skip updating any configured property replacers for the\n component. Instead you should call \#pushAllToContext\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|cssClasses|List=CSS style class(s) to be applied to the component\n\n <p>\n Declares style classes for the component. Multiple classes are specified\n with a space delimiter. This is used by the renderer to set the class\n attribute on the corresponding element. The class(s) declared must be\n available in the common style sheets or the style sheets specified for\n the view\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|dataAttributes|Map=Get the dataAttributes setup for this component - to be written to the html/jQuery data\n \n <p>\n The attributes that are complex objects (contain {}) they will be written through script. The\n attritubes that are simple (contain no objects) will be written directly to the html of the\n component using standard data-. Either way they can be access through .data() call in jQuery\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|disableSessionPersistence|boolean=Disables the storage of the component in session (when the framework determines it needs to be due to a\n refresh condition)\n\n <p>\n When the framework determines there is a condition on the component that requires it to keep around between\n posts, it will store the component instance in session. This flag can be set to disable this behavior (which\n would require custom application logic to support behavior such as refresh)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|finalizeMethodAdditionalArguments|List=The List of Object instances that should be passed as arguments to the finalize method\n\n <p>\n These arguments are passed to the finalize method after the standard model and component\n arguments. They are passed in the order declared in the list\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|finalizeMethodInvoker|MethodInvokerConfig={@code MethodInvokerConfig} instance for the method that should be invoked\n for finalizing the component configuration\n\n <p>\n MethodInvoker can be configured to specify the class or object the method\n should be called on. For static method invocations, the targetClass\n property can be configured. For object invocations, that targetObject\n property can be configured\n </p>\n\n <p>\n If the component is selfRendered, the finalize method can return a string which\n will be set as the component's renderOutput. The selfRendered indicator will also\n be set to true on the component.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|finalizeMethodToCall|String=The name of the method that should be invoked for finalizing the component\n configuration (full method name, without parameters or return type)\n\n <p>\n Note the method can also be set with the finalizeMethodInvoker\n targetMethod property. If the method is on the configured\n {@code ViewHelperService}, only this property needs to be configured\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The model backing the view will be passed as the first argument method and then\n the {@code Component} instance as the second argument. If any additional method\n arguments are declared with the finalizeMethodAdditionalArguments, they will then\n be passed in the order declared in the list\n </p>\n\n <p>\n If the component is selfRendered, the finalize method can return a string which\n will be set as the component's renderOutput. The selfRendered indicator will also\n be set to true on the component.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|forceSessionPersistence|boolean=Indicates whether the component should be stored with the session view regardless of configuration\n\n <p>\n By default the framework nulls out any components that do not have a refresh condition or are needed for\n collection processing. This can be a problem if custom application code is written to refresh a component\n without setting the corresponding component flag. In this case this property can be set to true to force the\n framework to keep the component in session. Defaults to false\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|hidden|boolean=Indicates whether the component should be hidden in the UI\n\n <p>\n How the hidden data is maintained depends on the views persistence mode.\n If the mode is request, the corresponding data will be rendered to the UI\n but not visible. If the mode is session, the data will not be rendered to\n the UI but maintained server side.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n For a {@code Container} component, the hidden setting will apply to\n all contained components (making a section hidden makes all fields within\n the section hidden)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|id|String=
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|methodToCallOnRefresh|String=Name of a method on the controller that should be invoked as part of the component refresh\n and disclosure process\n \n <p>\n During the component refresh or disclosure process it might be necessary to perform other\n operations, such as preparing data or executing a business process. This allows the\n configuration of a method on the underlying controller that should be called for the\n component refresh action. In this method, the necessary logic can be performed and then the\n base component update method invoked to carry out the component refresh.\n </p>\n \n <p>\n Controller method to invoke must accept the form, binding result, request, and response\n arguments\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|progressiveRenderAndRefresh|boolean=If true, when the progressiveRender condition is satisfied, the component will always be\n retrieved from the server and shown(as opposed to being stored on the client, but hidden,\n after the first retrieval as is the case with the progressiveRenderViaAJAX option).\n \n <p>\n <b>By default, this is false, so components with progressive render capabilities will always\n be already within the client html and toggled to be hidden or visible.</b>\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|progressiveRenderViaAJAX|boolean=When progressiveRenderViaAJAX is true, this component will be retrieved from the server when\n it first satisfies its progressive render condition.\n \n <p>\n After the first retrieval, it is hidden/shown in the html by the js when its progressive\n condition result changes. <b>By default, this is false, so components with progressive render\n capabilities will always be already within the client html and toggled to be hidden or\n visible.</b>\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|progressiveRender|String=When set if the condition is satisfied, the component will be displayed. The component MUST\n BE a container or field type. progressiveRender is defined in a limited Spring EL syntax.\n Only valid form property names, and, or, logical comparison operators (non-arithmetic),\n \#listContains, \#emptyList, matches clause are allowed. String and regex values must use\n single quotes ('), booleans must be either true or false, numbers must be a valid double,\n either negative or positive.\n \n <p>\n DO NOT use progressiveRender and a conditional refresh statement on the same component unless\n it is known that the component will always be visible in all cases when a conditional refresh\n happens (ie conditional refresh has progressiveRender's condition anded with its own\n condition).\n </p>\n \n <p>\n <b>If a component should be refreshed every time it is shown, use the\n progressiveRenderAndRefresh option with this property instead.</b>\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|propertyReplacers|List=gets a list of {@code PropertyReplacer} instances\n\n <p>They will be evaluated\n during the view lifecycle to conditionally set properties on the\n {@code Component} based on expression evaluations</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|readOnly|boolean=Indicates whether the component can be edited\n\n <p>\n When readOnly the controls and widgets of {@code Field} components\n will not be rendered. If the Field has an underlying value it will be\n displayed readOnly to the user.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n For a {@code Container} component, the readOnly setting will apply\n to all contained components (making a section readOnly makes all fields\n within the section readOnly).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|refreshTimer|int=Time in seconds that the component will be automatically refreshed\n \n <p>\n This will invoke the refresh process just like the conditionalRefresh and\n refreshWhenChangedPropertyNames. When using this property methodToCallOnRefresh and id should\n also be specified\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|refreshWhenChangedPropertyNames|List=Specifies a property by name that when its value changes will automatically perform\n a refresh on this component\n\n <p>\n This can be a comma\n separated list of multiple properties that require this component to be\n refreshed when any of them change. <Br>DO NOT use with progressiveRender\n unless it is know that progressiveRender condition will always be\n satisfied before one of these fields can be changed.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|renderedHtmlOutput|String=Rendering output for the component that will be sent as part of the\n response (can contain static text and HTML)
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|render|boolean=Indicates whether the component should be rendered in the UI\n\n <p>\n If set to false, the corresponding component template will not be invoked\n (therefore nothing will be rendered to the UI).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|required|Boolean=Indicates whether the component is required\n\n <p>\n At the general component level required means there is some action the\n user needs to take within the component. For example, within a section it\n might mean the fields within the section should be completed. At a field\n level, it means the field should be completed. This provides the ability\n for the renderers to indicate the required action.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|resetDataOnRefresh|boolean=Indicates whether data contained within the component should be reset (set to default) when the\n component is refreshed
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|retrieveViaAjax|boolean=When true, this component will render as a placeholder component instead of rendering normally because the\n content will be later retrieved through manually ajax retrieval calls in the js\n\n <p>This flag does not imply any automation, there must be a js call invoked for the content to be retrieved\n by the server, but this does mark it with a placeholder component which KRAD js uses during these calls.\n This placeholder component is used for ajax retrievals.  In particular, this flag is useful for use in\n combination with the <b>showLightboxComponent</b> js function which will automatically retrieve the\n real content of a component through ajax if a placeholder component is detected.  This allows for the full\n content to only be retrieved when the lightbox is first opened.\n When this flag is set to true, the forceSessionPersistence\n flag is set to true AUTOMATICALLY because it is implied that this component will be retrieved by an ajax call\n in the future.  This may also be useful for direct custom calls to <b>retrieveComponent</b> function,\n as well, which also relies on the placeholder being present.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|rowSpan|int=Number of places the component should take up vertically in the container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a {@code Container} and are placed using a\n {@code LayoutManager}. This property specifies how many places\n vertically the component should take up within the container. This is\n only applicable for table based layout managers. Default is 1\n </p>\n\n TODO\: this should not be on component interface since it only applies if\n the layout manager supports it, need some sort of layoutOptions map for\n field level options that depend on the manager
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|selfRendered|boolean=Indicates whether the component contains its own render output (through\n the renderOutput property)\n\n <p>\n If self rendered is true, the corresponding template for the component\n will not be invoked and the renderOutput String will be written to the\n response as is.\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|templateName|String=The name for which the template can be invoked by\n\n <p>\n Whether the template name is needed depends on the underlying rendering engine being used. In the example of\n Freemarker, the template points to the actual source file, which then loads a macro. From then on the macro is\n simply invoked to execute the template\n </p>\n\n <p>\n e.g. 'uif_text'\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|template|String=The path to the JSP file that should be called to render the component\n\n <p>\n The path should be relative to the web root. An attribute will be available to the component to use under the\n name given by the method {@code getComponentTypeName}. Based on the component type, additional attributes could\n be available for use. See the component documentation for more information on such attributes.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n e.g. '/krad/WEB-INF/jsp/tiles/component.jsp'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|title|String=The component title\n\n <p>\n Depending on the component can be used in various ways. For example with a Container component the title is\n used to set the header text. For components like controls other other components that render an HTML element it\n is used to set the HTML title attribute.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|toolTip|Tooltip=The Tooltip widget that renders a tooltip with additional information about the element on\n specified trigger event
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|valign|String=Vertical alignment of the component within its container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a <code>Container</code> and are placed using a\n <code>LayoutManager</code>. This property specifies how the component\n should be aligned vertically within the container. During the finalize\n phase the CSS vertical-align style will be created for the valign\n setting.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|width|String=Width the component should take up in the container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a <code>Container</code> and are placed using a\n <code>LayoutManager</code>. This property specifies a width the component\n should take up in the Container. This is not applicable for all layout\n managers. During the finalize phase the CSS width style will be created\n for the width setting.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n e.g. '30%', '55px'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentSecurity=Component security is used to flag permissions that exist in KIM for various component state (like edit and view)\n\n <p>\n In addition, properties such as additional role and permission details can be configured to use when\n checking the KIM permissions\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Security subclasses exist adding on flags apporiate for that component\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.PropertyReplacer=Configuration for replacing a property value based on a condition\n\n <p>\n A <code>Component</code> may be configured with one or more <code>PropertyReplacer</code> instances. Each defines\n a condition to evaluate during the apply model phase, and if that condition succeeds the property on the component\n given by {@link \#getPropertyName()}, will be replaced with the value given by {@link \#getReplacement()}. Conditions\n are defined using an expression language and may reference any variables available in the component's context.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Property replacers can be used to change out an entire Component or List/Map of Components. For example, based on a\n condition you might want to display a <code>TextControl</code> or <code>RadioControl</code> for an\n <code>InputField</code>. You can define the field with a text control, then include a property replacer as\n follows\:\n <pre>\n <bean parent\="PropertyReplacer" p\:propertyName\="control"\n p\:condition\="field1 eq '10985'" p\:replacement-ref\="RadioControl"/>\n\n </pre>\n\n Note <code>Component</code> contains a <code>List</code> or property replacers which will be evaluated in the order\n contained within the list. So in the above example if we wanted to now add a further condition which sets the\n control\n to a checkbox, we would just add another property replacer bean.\n <pre>\n   <property name\="propertyReplacers">\n <list>\n <bean parent\="PropertyReplacer" p\:propertyName\="control"\n p\:condition\="field1 eq '10985'" p\:replacement-ref\="RadioControl"/>\n <bean parent\="PropertyReplacer" p\:propertyName\="control"\n p\:condition\="field1 eq '11456'" p\:replacement-ref\="CheckboxControl"/>\n     </list>\n   </property>\n </pre>\n\n Property replacers may be used to substitute primitive properties as well, such as Strings\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.PropertyReplacer|condition|String=Gives the expression that should be evaluated to determine whether or not\n the property replacement should be made\n\n <p>\n Expression follows SPEL and may access any model data along with any variables\n available in the context for the Component. The expression should evaluate to\n a boolean. If the resulting boolean is true, the object given by {@link \#getReplacement()}\n will be set as the value for the associated property on the component. If the resulting\n boolean is false, no action will take place\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Note the value does not need to contain the expression placeholder @{}\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.PropertyReplacer|propertyName|String=Name of the property on the Component the property replacer is associated with that\n will be set when the condition for the replacer succeeds\n\n <p>\n Note the property name must be readable/writable on the component.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.BreadcrumbOptions=BreadcrumbOptions represents the options for the current view breadcrumbs that are displayed.\n\n <p>\n This class allows\n for complete override of all breadcrumbs, and ability to add breadcrumbs before the view and page breadcrumb items.\n Important note\: breadcrumbOptions for preViewBreadcrumbs, prePageBreadcrumbs, and\n breadcrumbOverrides are inherited from the View if not explicitly set from the PageGroup level's breadcrumbOptions\n (if they contain a value at the view level and the property is null at the page level - default behavior).\n Explicitly providing an empty list or setting these properties at the PageGroup level will\n override this inheritance.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.BreadcrumbOptions|breadcrumbOverrides|List=The breadcrumbOverrides are a complete override for all breadcrumbs shown expect for parent location/path\n breadcrumbs.\n\n <p>\n The BreadcrumbItems set in this list will be used instead of any View, PageGroup, preViewBreadcrumbs, or\n prePageBreadcrumbs BreadcrumbItems already set.  Each item can be customized fully.  If\n parent location/path breadcrumbs should also not be shown, set renderParentLocations to false.\n All other render options set in BreadcrumbOptions will be ignored/not apply as a result of setting this override\n list.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.BreadcrumbOptions|homewardPathBreadcrumbs|List=The homewardPathBreadcrumbs represent the path to "Home" location, these appear before anything else - including\n parentLocation/path based breadcrumbs.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.BreadcrumbOptions|prePageBreadcrumbs|List=The prePageBreadcrumbs list represents BreadcrumbItems that will be shown before the PageGroup's BreadcrumbItem,\n but after the View's BreadcrumbItem.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.BreadcrumbOptions|preViewBreadcrumbs|List=The preViewBreadcrumbs list represents BreadcrumbItems that will be shown before the View's BreadcrumbItem,\n but after any parent location breadcrumbs/path based breadcrumbs (if in use)
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo=ColumnCalculationInfo is used to specify which columns and what types of calculations are performed on those columns\n of table collection.  This functionality can only be used when the dataTables plugin is being used\n (richTable.render\="true" for TableLayoutManager)
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|calculateOnKeyUp|boolean=If true, the column is calculated when the user enters a character on each key up.  There is a small delay\n built in to prevent calculations from being fired for each key stroke.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|calculationFunctionExtraData|String=This specifies extra data to be sent to the calculation function.  This can be any valid javascript value\n (number, string, JSON - for passing multiple settings, etc).\n <br/>\n <b>The function specified by calculationFunctionName MUST take a second parameter when using this option.</b>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|calculationFunctionName|String=Gets the js calculationFunctionName.  This is the name of the js function to use in column calculations.\n\n <p>\n <b>This must be ONLY the function by name (no parenthesis or params)</b><br/>\n The actual js function declaration MUST take in an array of values as its first parameter.  The values passed in\n will be all the relavant values for the calculation.  Optionally, the function can also take a second parameter\n which can be specified by calculationFunctionExtraData.  This parameter can take any valid javascript value\n (integer, string, JSON object, etc).  In either case, the values parameter MUST be the first parameter.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|columnNumber|Integer=Gets the column number.  This should not be set through configuration as it is overridden by the\n propertyName's caclculated column number.  <b>Do not set through xml configuration</b>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|groupTotalFieldPrototype|MessageField=Gets the groupTotalFieldPrototype.  This field is copied and holds the groupTotal for the column\n and specifies its label. This SHOULD NOT BE SET except by the base bean (in MOST cases).
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|pageTotalField|MessageField=Gets the pageTotalField.  This field is the field which holds the pageTotal for the column\n and specifies its label. This SHOULD NOT BE SET except by the base bean (in MOST cases).
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|propertyName|String=Get the propertyName of the field to do calculations.  This field MUST exist as one of the fields\n of the collection.  <b>This property must be set or an exception will be thrown.</b>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|recalculateTotalClientSide|boolean=When set to false, calculations will not be fired for the totalField client-side.  This ONLY effects the\n totalField.  If page and group totals are still shown, they will (and can only) be calculated client-side.\n\n <p>\n To use this particular feature\: set this to false, and use springEL in the totalField's message.messageText\n to get a pre-calculated total from a field on the form.  This will be refreshed when the table is refreshed,\n but will not be updated by client-side interactions - used for complex or special calculation mechanisms\n that may require server only information.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|showGroupTotal|boolean=Gets showGroupTotal. showGroupTotal shows/calculates the total field for each grouping when true (and only\n when the table actually has grouping turned on), otherwise it is not rendered.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|showPageTotal|boolean=Gets showTotal. showTotal shows/calculates the total field when true, otherwise it is not rendered.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|showTotal|boolean=Gets showTotal. showTotal shows/calculates the total field when true, otherwise it is not rendered.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ColumnCalculationInfo|totalField|MessageField=Gets the totalField.  This field is the field which holds the total for the column and specifies its label.\n This SHOULD NOT BE SET except by the base bean (in MOST cases).

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.PageBreadcrumbOptions|renderHomewardPathBreadcrumbs|boolean=If true, render the homewardPathBreadcrumbs (if any are set), otherwise do not render them
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.PageBreadcrumbOptions|renderParentLocations|boolean=If true, render the parent location breadcrumbs.  These BreadcrumbItems are automatically generated based on the\n view's parentLocation property settings by traversing parent views/pages or based on a history path.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.PageBreadcrumbOptions|renderPrePageBreadcrumbs|boolean=If true, render the prePageBreadcrumbs (if any are set), otherwise do not render them
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.PageBreadcrumbOptions|renderPreViewBreadcrumbs|boolean=If true, render the preViewBreadcrumbs (if any are set), otherwise do not render them

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation=ParentLocation is used to provide automatic generation/determination of Views/Pages that occur before the current\n View.  Essentially, this class provides a way to determine a conceptual hierarchy of view/page locations.\n This information is used internally to generate BreadcrumbItems that can appear before the View's breadcrumbs.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation|pageBreadcrumbItem|BreadcrumbItem=The pageBreadcrumbItem to use for the parent location view breadcrumb.  Url should NOT be set here because\n parentPageUrl is ALWAYS set into this breadcrumbItem, regardless of value.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation|parentPageLabel|String=The parentPageLabel is the text used for breadcrumbItem label of the parent page.\n\n <p>\n If not set, the the label is determined\n by looking at the parent PageGroup's breadcrumbItem and then its headerText.  This retrieval can only happen\n if the parentViewUrl is set.\n If the parent PageGroup's retrieved value\n contain expressions, those expressions must be able to be evaluated in the current context (ie, the properties\n they reference must also exist on the current form at the same location) or an exception will be thrown.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation|parentPageUrl|UrlInfo=The parentPageUrl representing a page url that is the parent of this View.  In order for automated label\n determination to work for the page breadcrumbItem, the viewId and controllerMapping must match with the\n parentViewUrl.\n\n <p>\n This url can explicitly set an href or can set a pageId.  The parentViewUrl MUST be set before this option can\n be set.  If the needed behavior is such that the parent view breadcrumbItem should not be shown and only this\n item should be shown, set 'parentLocation.viewBreadcrumbItem.render' to false.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation|parentViewLabel|String=The parentViewLabel is the text used for breadcrumbItem label of the parent view.\n\n <p>\n If not set, the the label is determined\n by looking at the parent View's breadcrumbItem and then its headerText.  If the parent view's retrieved value\n contain expressions, those expressions must be able to be evaluated in the current context (ie, the properties\n they reference must also exist on the current form at the same location) or an exception will be thrown.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation|parentViewUrl|UrlInfo=The parentViewUrl representing the url that is the parent of this View.\n\n <p>\n This url can explicitly set an href\n or can set a controller and viewId.  Parent view traversal is only performed if the controller and viewId\n properties are set and NOT the explicit href (this affects if breadcrumbs are generated in a recursive chain).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.ParentLocation|viewBreadcrumbItem|BreadcrumbItem=The viewBreadcrumbItem to use for the parent location view breadcrumb.  Url should NOT be set here because\n parentViewUrl is ALWAYS set into this breadcrumbItem, regardless of value.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.util.UrlInfo=This object represents a url in the Krad framework.  The url can be set explicitly to a specific href or a\n controller\n plus a viewId can be provided (at very minimum).  By default, the krad base bean config points the baseUrl property\n to 'krad.url' configuration property and the methodToCall to 'start', but these can be reset to any value as needed.\n\n <p>\n If href is not set, the generated value of href is constructed (in general) as follows\:<br/>\n baseUrl + /controllerMapping + ? + methodToCall param + viewId param + other parameters\n <br/>\n with any necessary tokens to construct a valid url.  If baseUrl is not provided, the url is not valid and a\n blank string is returned.\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.InquiryView=Type of <code>View</code> that provides a read-only display of a record of\n data (object instance)\n\n <p>\n The <code>InquiryView</code> provides the interface for the Inquiry\n framework. It works with the <code>Inquirable</code> service and inquiry\n controller. The view does render a form to support the configuration of\n actions to perform operations on the data.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Inquiry views are primarily configured by the object class they are\n associated with. This provides the default dictionary information for the\n fields. If more than one inquiry view is needed for the same object class,\n the view name can be used to further identify an unique view\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.InquiryView|dataObjectClassName|Class=Class name for the object the inquiry applies to\n\n <p>\n The object class name is used to pick up a dictionary entry which will\n feed the attribute field definitions and other configuration.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.MaintenanceDocumentView=View type for Maintenance documents\n\n <p>\n Supports primary display for a new maintenance record, in which case the\n fields are display for populating the new record, and an edit maintenance\n record, which is a comparison view with the old record read-only on the left\n side and the new record (changed record) on the right side\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The <code>MaintenanceDocumentView</code> provides the interface for the maintenance\n framework. It works with the <code>Maintainable</code> service and\n maintenance controller.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Maintenance views are primarily configured by the object class they are\n associated with. This provides the default dictionary information for the\n fields. If more than one maintenance view is needed for the same object\n class, the view name can be used to further identify an unique view\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.MaintenanceDocumentView|dataObjectClassName|Class=Class name for the object the maintenance document applies to\n\n <p>\n The object class name is used to pick up a dictionary entry which will\n feed the attribute field definitions and other configuration. In addition\n it is used to configure the <code>Maintainable</code> which will carry\n out the maintenance action\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.MaintenanceDocumentView|maintenanceAction|String=Indicates what maintenance action (new, edit, copy) was\n requested
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.MaintenanceDocumentView|oldObjectBindingPath|String=Gives the binding path to the old object (record being edited) to display\n for comparison
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View=Root of the component tree which encompasses a set of related\n <code>GroupContainer</code> instances tied together with a common page layout\n and navigation.\n\n <p>\n The <code>View</code> component ties together all the components and\n configuration of the User Interface for a piece of functionality. In Rice\n applications the view is typically associated with a <code>Document</code>\n instance.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The view template lays out the common header, footer, and navigation for the\n related pages. In addition the view renders the HTML head element bringing in\n common script files and style sheets, along with optionally rendering a form\n element for pages that need to post data back to the server.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Configuration of UIF features such as model validation is also done through\n the <code>View</code>\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewAuthorizerBase=Implementation of {@link ViewAuthorizer} that verifies authorization with KIM permission checks\n\n <p>\n Each permission goes through one of the isAuthorized methods provided by\n {@link org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.DataObjectAuthorizer}, these in turn call {@link \#addPermissionDetails(Object, java.util.Map)}\n and {@link \#addRoleQualification(Object, java.util.Map)} for building the permission and role maps to send with\n the permission check. Subclasses can override these methods to add additional attributes\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewAuthorizerBase|configurationService|ConfigurationService=
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewPresentationControllerBase=Implementation of {@link ViewPresentationController} that implements no logic by default
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme=Holds a configuration of CSS and JS assets that provides the base for one or more views.\n\n <p>\n The list of CSS and JS files that are sourced in for a view come from its theme, along with any\n additional files configured for the specific view. Generally an application will have one theme for the\n entire application.\n\n The theme has logic for 'dev' mode versus 'test/prod' mode. This is controlled through the\n {@code rice.krad.dev.mode} configuration variable. In development mode it will source in all the CSS\n and JS files individually (to allow for easier debugging). In non-development mode it will source in a\n minified file. The path for the minified files can be specified by setting {@link \#getMinCssFile()} and\n {@link \#getMinScriptFile()}. If not set, it will be formed by using the {@link \#getName()},\n {@link \#getMinVersionSuffix()}, and min suffix (this is the file name generated by the theme builder). To\n indicate the min file should not be sourced in regardless of the environment, set the property\n {@link \#isIncludeMinFiles()} to false\n\n The path to the minified file is determined by {@link \#getDirectory()}. It this is not set, it is defaulted to\n be '/themes' plus the name of the theme (eg '/themes/kboot')\n </p>\n\n <p>\n There are two ways the theme can be configured, manual or by convention. If you want to manually configured the\n view theme, set {@link \#isUsesThemeBuilder()} to false. For dev mode, you must then set the {@link\n \#getMinCssSourceFiles()} and {@link \#getMinScriptSourceFiles()} lists to the theme files. For configuration\n by convention, only the theme {@link \#getName()} is required. The directory will be assumed to be '/themes/{name}'.\n Furthermore the list of min CSS and JS files will be retrieved from the theme.properties file created by the\n theme builder\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|cssFiles|List=List of file paths (relative to the web root) or URLs that will be sourced into the view\n as CSS files\n\n <p>\n Generally this list should be left empty, and the min file lists configured instead (or none with\n theme builder). However if there are resources that are not part of the minified CSS file that should\n be included with the theme they can be added here\n\n The minified file path (or list of individual files that make up the minification) will be added\n to the beginning of this list. Therefore any entries explicitly added through configuration will be\n sourced in last\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|directory|String=Path to the directory (relative to the web root) that holds the assets for the theme\n\n <p>\n When using the theme builder the directory is not required and will default to '/themes/{name}'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|imageDirectory|String=Path to the directory (relative to the web root) that contains images for the theme\n\n <p>\n Configured directory will populate the {@link org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.UifConstants.ContextVariableNames\#THEME_IMAGES}\n context variable which can be referenced with an expression for an image source\n </p>\n\n <p>\n When using the theme builder the image directory is not required and will default to a sub directory of the\n theme directory with name 'images'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|minCssFile|String=File path for the minified CSS file\n\n <p>\n When min file is not set it will be generated by using the theme directory, name, version, and min prefix.\n This corresponds to the min file names generated by the theme builder\n\n For example, with name 'kboot' and version '2.3.0' the min file name will be\n '/themes/kboot/stylesheets/kboot.2.3.0.min.css'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|minCssSourceFiles|List=List of file paths (relative to web root) or URLs that make up the minified CSS file\n\n <p>\n In development mode, instead of sourcing in the min CSS file, the list of files specified here will\n be included. This is to facilitate easier debugging. When using the theme builder this list is automatically\n retrieved and populated from the theme properties\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|minScriptFile|String=File path for the minified JS file\n\n <p>\n When min file is not set it will be generated by using the theme directory, name, version, and min prefix.\n This corresponds to the min file names generated by the theme builder\n\n For example, with name 'kboot' and version '2.3.0' the min file name will be\n '/themes/kboot/scripts/kboot.2.3.0.min.js'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|minScriptSourceFiles|List=List of file paths (relative to web root) or URLs that make up the minified JS file\n\n <p>\n In development mode, instead of sourcing in the min JS file, the list of files specified here will\n be included. This is to facilitate easier debugging. When using the theme builder this list is automatically\n retrieved and populated from the theme properties\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|minVersionSuffix|String=When the min file paths are not set, the min file names will be generated using the theme\n name, version, and the min suffix. This property is set to indicate the version number to use\n\n <p>\n For application themes this can be set to the config parameter ${app.version}\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|name|String=A name that identifies the view theme, when using the theme builder this should be the same as\n the directory (for example, if directory is '/themes/kboot', the theme name will be 'kboot')\n\n <p>\n <b>When using the theme builder (config by convention), the name is required configuration</b>\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|scriptFiles|List=List of file paths (relative to the web root) or URLs that will be sourced into the view\n as JS files\n\n <p>\n Generally this list should be left empty, and the min file lists configured instead (or none with\n theme builder). However if there are resources that are not part of the minified JS file that should\n be included with the theme they can be added here\n\n The minified file path (or list of individual files that make up the minification) will be added\n to the beginning of this list. Therefore any entries explicitly added through configuration will be\n sourced in last\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.ViewTheme|usesThemeBuilder|boolean=Indicates whether the theme has been built (or will be built) using the theme builder and therefore\n the theme configuration can be defaulted according to the conventions used by the builder\n\n <p>\n When set to true, only the {@link \#getName()} property is required to be configured for the theme. All\n other configuration will be determined based on convention. When manually configuring the theme, this flag\n should be turned off (by default this flag is on)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|actionFlags|Map=Map of strings that flag what actions can be taken in the UI\n <p>\n These can be used in conditional expressions in the dictionary or by\n other UI logic\n </p>

These files are brought into the HTML page along with\n common CSS files configured for the Rice application. Each entry should\n contain the path to the CSS file, either a relative path, path from web\n root, or full URI\n <p>\n e.g. '/krad/css/stacked-view.css', '../css/stacked-view.css',\n 'http\://my.edu/web/stacked-view.css'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|additionalScriptFiles|List=Declares additional script files that should be included with the\n <code>View</code>. These files are brought into the HTML page along with\n common script files configured for the Rice application. Each entry\n contain the path to the CSS file, either a relative path, path from web\n root, or full URI\n <p>\n e.g. '/krad/scripts/myScript.js', '../scripts/myScript.js',\n 'http\://my.edu/web/myScript.js'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|applicationFooter|Group=Footer for the application containing the view\n\n <p>\n When deploying outside a portal, the application header and footer property can be configured to\n display a consistent header/footer across all views. Here such things as application links, copyrights\n and so on can be rendered.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|applicationHeader|Header=Header for the application containing the view\n\n <p>\n When deploying outside a portal, the application header and footer property can be configured to\n display a consistent header/footer across all views. Here application logos, menus, login controls\n and so on can be rendered.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|applyDirtyCheck|boolean=Indicates whether the form should be validated for dirtyness\n\n <p>\n For FormView, it's necessary to validate when the user tries to navigate out of the form. If set, all the\n InputFields will be validated on refresh, navigate, cancel or close Action or on form\n unload and if dirty, displays a message and user can decide whether to continue with\n the action or stay on the form. For lookup and inquiry, it's not needed to validate.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|authorizer|ViewAuthorizer=Authorizer that should be used for the <code>View</code> instance\n\n <p>\n The authorizer class is consulted to determine component (group, field)\n state such as required, read-only, and hidden based on the users\n permissions. It typically communicates with the Kuali Identity Management\n system to determine roles and permissions.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|breadcrumbs|Breadcrumbs=Breadcrumb widget used for displaying homeward path and history
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|defaultBindingObjectPath|String=For <code>View</code> types that work primarily with one nested object of\n the form (for instance document, or bo) the default binding object path\n can be set for each of the views <code>DataBinding</code> components. If\n the component does not set its own binding object path it will inherit\n the default
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|dialogs|List=Provide a list of dialog groups associated with this view
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|editModes|Map=Map of edit modes that enabled for the view\n\n <p>\n These can be used in conditional expressions in the dictionary or by\n other UI logic\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|entryPageId|String=Specifies what page should be rendered by default. This is the page that\n will be rendered when the <code>View</code> is first rendered or when the\n current page is not set
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|expressionVariables|Map=Map that contains expressions to evaluate and make available as variables\n for conditional expressions within the view\n\n <p>\n Each Map entry contains one expression variables, where the map key gives\n the name for the variable, and the map value gives the variable\n expression.

When these properties are\n encountered in the object graph, this <code>Map</code> will be consulted\n to determine the concrete type to use.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n e.g. Suppose we have a property document.accountingLine.accountNumber and\n the accountingLine property on the document instance has an interface\n type 'AccountingLine'. We can then put an entry into this map with key\n 'document.accountingLine', and value\n 'org.kuali.rice.sampleapp.TravelAccountingLine'. When getting the\n property type or an entry from the dictionary for accountNumber, the\n TravelAccountingLine class will be used.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|page|PageGroup=For single paged views ({@link \#isSinglePageView()}, gives the page\n <code>Group</code> the view should render. The actual items for the page\n is taken from the group's items list ({@link \#getItems()}, and set onto\n the give page group. This is for convenience of configuration.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|parentLocation|ParentLocation=The parentLocation defines urls that represent the parent of a View in a conceptial site hierarchy.\n\n <p>\n By defining a parent with these urls defined, a breadcrumb chain can be generated and displayed automatically\n before this View's breadcrumbItem(s).  To chain multiple views, the urls must be defining viewId and\n controllerMapping settings instead of setting an href directly (this will end the chain).  If labels are\n not set on parentLocations, the labels will attempt to be derived from parent views/pages breadcrumbItem\n and headerText - if these contain expressions which cannot be evaluated in the current context an exception\n will be thrown.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|persistFormToSession|boolean=Indicates whether the form (model) associated with the view should be stored in the user session\n\n <p>\n The form class (or model) is used to hold the data that backs the view along with the built view object. Storing\n the form instance in session allows many things\:\n\n <ul>\n <li>Data does not need to be rebuilt for each server request (for example a collection)</li>\n <li>Data that does not need to go to the user can remain on the form, reducing the size of the response and\n improving security</li>\n <li>Data can be keep around in a 'pre-save' state. When requested by the user changes can then be persisted to\n the database</li>\n <li>Certain information about the view that was rendered, such as input fields, collection paths, and refresh\n components can be kept on the form to support UI interaction</li>\n </ul>\n\n Setting this flag to false will prevent the form from being kept in session and as a result will limit what can\n be done by the framework. In almost all cases this is not recommended.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Note all forms will be cleared when the user session expires (based on the rice configuration). In addition, the\n framework enables clear points on certain actions to remove the form when it is no longer needed\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|preLoadScript|String=Script that is executed at the beginning of page load (before any other script)\n\n <p>\n Many used to set server variables client side\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|presentationController|ViewPresentationController=PresentationController that should be used for the <code>View</code> instance\n\n <p>\n The presentation controller is consulted to determine component (group,\n field) state such as required, read-only, and hidden. The presentation\n controller does not take into account user permissions. The presentation\n controller can also output action flags and edit modes that will be set\n onto the view instance and can be referred to by conditional expressions\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|refreshBlockUI|BlockUI=
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|singlePageView|boolean=Indicates whether the <code>View</code> only has a single page\n <code>Group</code> or contains multiple page <code>Group</code>\n instances. In the case of a single page it is assumed the group's items\n list contains the section groups for the page, and the page itself is\n given by the page property ({@link \#getPage()}. This is for convenience\n of configuration and also can drive other configuration like styling.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|stateMapping|StateMapping=Gets the stateMapping.\n\n <p>The state mapping object is used to determine the state information for a view,\n it must include an ordered list of states, and where to find the state information for the view.\n A stateMapping must be set for state based validation to occur.  When stateMapping information is\n not included, the view's model is considered stateless and all constraints will apply regardless of their\n state information or replacements (ie, they will function as they did in version 2.1).</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|stateObjectBindingPath|String=The stateObject's binding path, this will be used along with the StateMapping's statePropertyName to\n determine what field in the model state information is stored in for this view.  Used during View validation.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|viewName|String=View name provides an identifier for a view within a type. That is if a\n set of <code>View</code> instances have the same values for the\n properties that are used to retrieve them by their type, the name can be\n given to further qualify the view that should be retrieved.\n <p>\n A view type like the <code>LookupView</code> might have several views for\n the same object class, but one that is the 'default' lookup and another\n that is the 'advanced' lookup. Therefore the name on the first could be\n set to 'default', and likewise the name for the second 'advanced'.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|viewTypeName|UifConstants.ViewType=View type name the view is associated with the view instance\n\n <p>\n Views that share common features and functionality can be grouped by the\n view type. Usually view types extend the <code>View</code> class to\n provide additional configuration and to set defaults. View types can also\n implement the <code>ViewTypeService</code> to add special indexing and\n retrieval of views.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Accordion=Accordion widget class used to create an accordion based layout
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Accordion|active|String=The active option determines which accordion item is open by default.  Set "false" as the string for\n no item open, use zero-based index to select an item to be open by default.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry=Widget for rendering an Inquiry link or DirectInquiry action field\n\n <p>\n The inquiry widget will render a button for the field value when\n that field is editable. When read only the widget will create a link on the display value.\n It points to the associated inquiry view for the field. The inquiry can be configured to point to a certain\n {@code InquiryView}, or the framework will attempt to associate the field with a inquiry based on\n its metadata (in particular its relationships in the model).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|baseInquiryUrl|String=Returns the URL for the inquiry for which parameters will be added\n\n <p>\n The base URL includes the domain, context, and controller mapping for the inquiry invocation. Parameters are\n then added based on configuration to complete the URL. This is generally defaulted to the application URL and\n internal KRAD servlet mapping, but can be changed to invoke another application such as the Rice standalone\n server\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|dataObjectClassName|String=Full class name the inquiry should be provided for\n\n <p>\n This is passed on to the inquiry request for the data object the lookup should be rendered for. This is then\n used by the inquiry framework to select the lookup view (if more than one inquiry view exists for the same\n data object class name, the {@link \#getViewName()} property should be specified to select the view to render).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|directInquiryAction|Action={@code Action} that will be rendered next to the field for a direct inquiry
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|enableDirectInquiry|boolean=Indicates that the direct inquiry will not be rendered

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LightBox|width|String=
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LocationSuggest=LocationSuggest widget for providing suggestions that represent locations.  When the suggestion is clicked, the\n navigation occurs immediately.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LocationSuggest|additionalRequestParameters|Map=AdditionalRequestParameters specify the static(constant) request parameters that should be appended to the url.\n\n <p>The key represents the key of the request parameter and the value represents the value of the\n request parameter.  This will be used on each suggestion which uses a generated url (using baseUrl\n construction).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LocationSuggest|additionalUrlPathPropertyName|String=AdditionalUrlPathProperty specifies the property on the retrieved suggestion result that contains a url\n appendage\n to be appended to the baseUrl when this selection is chosen.\n\n <p>One use case for setting this is to retrieve a controllerMapping that changes based on selection.  Note\:\n for suggestions that all point to the same controllerMapping, simply set it as part of the baseUrl.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LocationSuggest|baseUrl|String=BaseUrl for the suggestions.  Unless the suggestion contains an href, baseUrl + additionalUrlPath value +\n request parameters is used to generate the url.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LocationSuggest|hrefPropertyName|String=The hrefPropertyName specifies the property on the retrieved suggestion result that contains the href\n value (full url).\n\n <p>This property must contain a full url if it exists on the object.  If this property name is matched on\n the suggestion result, it takes precedence over any other settings set on this locationSuggest\n and is used as the navigation url.  If the property name does not exist on the object, the suggest will fall\n back to building the url dynamically with baseUrl.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LocationSuggest|requestParameterPropertyNames|Map=RequestParameterPropertyNames specify the properties that should be included in the request parameters.\n\n <p>The key is used as the key of the request parameter and the value is used as the property name to look for in\n the suggestion result object.  If the property name specified exists on the result object, the request\n parameter in the url will appear as key\=propertyValue in the request parameters.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder=Widget for navigating to a lookup from a field (called a quickfinder).
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|autoSearch|Boolean=Indicates whether the search should be executed when first rendering the lookup view.\n\n <p>By default the lookup view is rendered, the user enters search values and executes the results. This flag can\n be set to true to indicate the search should be performed before showing the screen to the user. This is\n generally used when search criteria is being passed in as well</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|baseLookupUrl|String=Returns the URL for the lookup for which parameters will be added.\n\n <p>The base URL includes the domain, context, and controller mapping for the lookup invocation. Parameters are\n then added based on configuration to complete the URL. This is generally defaulted to the application URL and\n internal KRAD servlet mapping, but can be changed to invoke another application such as the Rice standalone\n server</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|dataObjectClassName|String=Full class name the lookup should be provided for.\n\n <p>This is passed on to the lookup request for the data object the lookup should be rendered for. This is then\n used by the lookup framework to select the lookup view (if more than one lookup view exists for the same\n data object class name, the {@link \#getViewName()} property should be specified to select the view to\n render).</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|fieldConversions|Map=Map that determines what properties from a result lookup row (if selected) will be returned to properties on\n the calling view.\n\n <p>The purpose of using the lookup is to search for a particular value and return that value to the form being\n completed. In order for the lookup framework to return the field back to us, we must specify the name of the\n field on the data object class whose value we need, and the name of the field on the calling view. Furthermore,\n we can choose to have the lookup return additional fields that populate other form fields or informational\n properties (see \u2018Field Queries and Informational Properties\u2019). These pairs of fields are known as\n \u2018field conversions\u2019.</p>\n\n <p>The fieldConversions property is a Map. Each entry represents a field that will be returned back from the\n lookup, with the entry key being the field name on the data object class, and the entry value being the field\n name on the calling view. It is helpful to think of this as a from-to mapping. Pulling from the data object\n field (map key) to the calling view field (map value).</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lightBox|LightBox=Lightbox widget that will be used to view the invoked lookup view.\n\n <p>Note if the lightbox is not configured, or set to not render the lookup will be invoked based on\n the action alone (for example a new tab/window)</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lookupCollectionName|String=For the case of multi-value lookup, indicates the collection that should be populated with\n the return results.\n\n <p>Note when the quickfinder is associated with a {@link CollectionGroup}, this property is\n set automatically from the collection name associated with the group</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lookupParameters|Map=Map that determines what properties from a calling view will be sent to properties on that are rendered\n for the lookup view's search fields (they can be hidden).\n\n <p> When invoking a lookup view, we can pre-populate search fields on the lookup view with data from the view\n that called the lookup. The user can then perform the search with these values, or (if edited is allowed or\n the fields are not hidden) change the passed in values. When the lookup is invoked, the values for the\n properties configured within the lookup parameters Map will be pulled and passed along as values for the\n lookup view properties</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|multipleValuesSelect|Boolean=Indicates whether the invoked lookup view should allow multiple values to be selected and returned.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|quickfinderAction|Action=Action component that is used to rendered for the field for invoking the quickfinder action (bringing up the\n lookup).\n\n <p>Through the action configuration the image (or link, button) rendered for the quickfinder can be modified. In\n addition to other action component settings</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|readOnlyLookupFields|String=Comma delimited String of property names on the lookup view that should be read only.\n\n <p>When requesting a lookup view, property names for fields that are rendered as search criteria can be marked\n as read-only. This is usually done when a lookup parameter for that property is sent in and the user should\n not be allowed to change the value</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|referencesToRefresh|String=List of property names on the model that should be refreshed when the lookup returns.\n\n <p>Note this is only relevant when the return by script option is not enabled (meaning the server will be\n invoked\n on the lookup return call)</p>\n\n <p>When a lookup return call is made (to return a result value) the controller refresh method will be invoked.\n If\n refresh properties are configured, a call to refresh those references from the database will be made. This is\n useful if the lookup returns a foreign key field and the related record is needed.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|renderCriteriaActions|Boolean=Indicates whether the criteria actions (footer) should be rendered on the invoked lookup view.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|renderLookupCriteria|Boolean=Indicates whether the lookup criteria (search group) should be enabled on the invoked lookup view.\n\n <p> Setting the this to false will not display the lookup criteria but only the results. Therefore this is only\n useful when setting {@link \#getAutoSearch()} to true and passing in criteria</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|renderMaintenanceLinks|Boolean=Indicates whether the maintenance action links should be rendered for the invoked lookup view.\n\n <p>If a maintenance view exists for the data object associated with the lookup view, the framework will add\n links to initiate a new maintenance document. This flag can be used to disable the rendering of these links</p>\n\n <p> Note this serves similar purpose to {@link \#getRenderResultActions()} but the intent is to only remove the\n maintenance links in this situation, not the complete actions column</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|renderResultActions|Boolean=Indicates whether the maintenance actions (or others) are rendered on the invoked lookup view.\n\n <p>By default a lookup view will add an actions column for the result table that display maintenance links (in\n addition to a new link at the top of the page) if a maintenance action is available. Custom links can also be\n added to the action column as necessary. This flag can be set to true to suppress the rendering of the actions\n for the lookup call.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|renderReturnLink|Boolean=Indicates whether the return links for lookup results should be rendered.\n\n <p>A lookup view can be invoked to allow the user to select a value (or set of values) to return back to the\n calling view. For single value lookups this is done with a return link that is rendered for each row. This\n return link can be disabled by setting this property to false</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|viewName|String=When multiple target lookup views exists for the same data object class, the view name can be set to\n determine which one to use.\n\n <p>When creating multiple lookup views for the same data object class, the view name can be specified for the\n different versions (for example 'simple' and 'advanced'). When multiple lookup views exist the view name must\n be sent with the data object class for the request. Note the view id can be alternatively used to uniquely\n identify the lookup view</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable=Decorates a HTML Table client side with various tools\n \n <p>\n Decorations implemented depend on widget implementation. Examples are sorting, paging and\n skinning.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable|ajaxSource|String=Specifies a URL for acquiring the table data with ajax\n \n <p>\n When the ajax source URL is specified the rich table plugin will retrieve the data by\n invoking the URL and building the table rows from the result. This is different from the\n standard use of the rich table plugin with uses progressive enhancement to decorate a table\n that has already been rendereed\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable|disableTableSort|boolean=Returns true if sorting is disabled
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable|emptyTableMessage|String=Returns the text which is used to display text when the table is empty
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable|hiddenColumns|Set=Holds propertyNames for the ones meant to be hidden since columns are visible by default\n \n <p>\n Duplicate entries are ignored and the order of entries is not significant\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable|showExportOption|boolean=Returns true if export option is enabled
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.RichTable|sortableColumns|Set=Holds the propertyNames for columns that are to be sorted\n \n <p>\n Duplicate entries are ignored and the order of entries is not significant\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Scrollpane|height|String=Height the content should take up in the group\n\n <p>\n If the content size exceeds the height then a scroll bar will be shown.\n </p>\n <p>\n e.g. '30%' or '55px'\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Spinner=Widget that decorates a control transforming into a spinner\n\n <p>\n Spinners allow the incrementing or decrementing of the controls value with an arrow up and down icon on\n the right side of the control. How the value is incremented, min/max values, and so on can be configured\n through the {@link org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.Component\#getTemplateOptions()} property\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest=Widget that provides dynamic select options to the user as they\n are entering the value (also known as auto-complete)\n\n <p>\n Widget is backed by an <code>AttributeQuery</code> that provides\n the configuration for executing a query server side that will retrieve\n the valid option values\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|additionalPropertiesToReturn|List=List of additional properties to return in the result objects to the plugin's success callback.\n\n <p>In most cases, this should not be set.  The main use case\n of setting this list is to use additional properties in the select function on the plugin's options, so\n it is only recommended that this property be set when doing heavy customization to the select function.\n This list is not used if the full result object is already being returned.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|labelPropertyName|String=Name of the property on the query result object that provides the label for the suggestion.\n\n <p>This should\n be set when the label that the user selects is different from the value that is inserted when a user selects a\n suggestion. If only one of labelPropertyName or valuePropertyName is set,\n the property's value on the object will be used for both the value inserted on selection and the suggestion\n text (most default cases only a valuePropertyName would be set).</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|retrieveAllSuggestions|boolean=Indicates whether all suggest options should be retrieved up front and provide to the suggest\n widget as options locally\n\n <p>\n Use this for a small list of options to improve performance. The query will be performed on the client\n to filter the provider options based on the users input instead of doing a query each time\n </p>\n\n <p>\n When a query method is configured and this option set to true the method will be invoked to set the\n options. The query method should not take any arguments and should return the suggestion options\n List or the JS String as a result. If a query method is not configured the suggest options can be\n set through configuration or a view helper method (for example a component finalize method)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|returnFullQueryObject|boolean=When set to true the results of a query method will be sent back as-is (in translated form) with all properties\n intact.\n\n <p>\n Note this is not supported for highly complex objects (ie, most auto-query objects - will throw exception).\n Intended usage of this flag is with custom query methods which return simple data objects.\n The query method can return a list of Strings which will be used for the suggestions, a list of objects\n with 'label' and 'value' properties, or a custom object.  In the case of using a customObject\n labelPropertyName or valuePropertyName MUST be specified (or both) OR the custom object must contain a\n property named "label" or "value" (or both) for the suggestions to appear.  In cases where this is not used,\n the data sent back represents a slim subset of the properties on the object.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|suggestOptions|List=When {@link \#isRetrieveAllSuggestions()} is true, this list provides the full list of suggestions\n\n <p>\n If a query method is configured that method will be invoked to populate this list, otherwise the\n list should be populated through configuration or the view helper\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The suggest options can either be a list of Strings, in which case the strings will be the suggested\n values. Or a list of objects. If the object does not have 'label' and 'value' properties, a custom render\n and select method must be provided\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|suggestQuery|AttributeQuery=Attribute query instance the will be executed to provide\n the suggest options
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|valuePropertyName|String=Name of the property on the query result object that provides\n the options for the suggest, values from this field will be\n collected and sent back on the result to provide as suggest options.\n\n <p>If a labelPropertyName is also set,\n the property specified by it will be used as the label the user selects (the suggestion), but the value will\n be the value retrieved by this property.  If only one of labelPropertyName or valuePropertyName is set,\n the property's value on the object will be used for both the value inserted on selection and the suggestion\n text (most default cases only a valuePropertyName would be set).</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.SyntaxHighlighter=Widget that renders text syntax highlighted\n\n <p>\n The widget renders a div with a header. In the div the source code text will be added in pre tags with the\n specified plugin class that is needed for the plugin to alter the text.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.SyntaxHighlighter|header|Header=
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.SyntaxHighlighter|pluginCssClass|String=The class that will be set on the pre tags\n\n <p>\n The class is used by the prettify plugin to identify text to highlight and to specify type of highlighting.\n </p>
