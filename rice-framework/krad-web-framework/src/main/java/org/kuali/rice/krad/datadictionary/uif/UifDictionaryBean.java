     * The expression graph map key gives the property name (possibly nested) the expression was
     * configured on, and the map value gives the expression. During the view lifecycle, see
     * {@link PopulateComponentFromExpressionGraphTask} and
     * {@link PopulateReplacersAndModifiersFromExpressionGraphTask}, the expressions are moved to
     * the {@link #getPropertyExpressions()} map for the configurable they should be evaluated on

     * to set as the Map key. The expressions are then evaluated during the apply model phase and the result is set as
     * the property value.
