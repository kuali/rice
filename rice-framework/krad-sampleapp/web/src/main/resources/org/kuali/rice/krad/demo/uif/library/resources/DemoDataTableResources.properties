@cmp{Demo-DataTable-Example1}#instructionalText=DataTable (builds table using Ajax source) with infinite scrolling enabled
@cmp{Demo-DataTableView}#description=\
  Content element that renders a table using the {@link RichTable} widget configured with an Ajax (or Javascript)\
   data source\
   \
   <p>\
   Note this is different from the table layout manager in that it does not render nested components. The data is\
   provided directly to the rich table widget which will create the table rows (unlike the table layout which creates\
   the table from components then invokes the table plugin to decorate). Therefore this component just creates a table\
   element tag and invokes the rich table script\
   </p>\
   \
   <p>\
   Nested HTML can be given through the rich table data. However generally this will be read-only data with possibly\
   some inquiry links\
   </p>
