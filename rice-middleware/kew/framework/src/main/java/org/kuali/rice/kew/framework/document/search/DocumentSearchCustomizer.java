/**
 * Provides various mechanisms for an application to customize the behavior of the Document Search functionality for
 * their document types.  Client applications should provide implementations of this interface if they need to
 * enact some of these customizations on document searches.  These customizers then get mapped to the appropriate
 * document types via the KEW extension framework (see
 * {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.api.extension.ExtensionRepositoryService}).
 *
 * <p>The customization functionality provided by this interface includes:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The ability to customize document search criteria before it gets submitted.</li>
 *     <li>The ability to customize how document search criteria is cleared.</li>
 *     <li>The ability to customize how result data is processed and presented.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Only one {@code DocumentSearchCustomizer} is supported for a given document type.  It is important to note however
 * that it is permitted that an implementation of this interface could be tied to more than one document type via the
 * extension framework.  This is why information about the specific document type for which the customizations is being
 * applied is passed to all methods on this interface (note that the document type information is available from the
 * {@code DocumentSearchCriteria} as well.</p>
 *
 * <p>Furthermore, the customization hooks afforded by this interface will only be executed when a valid document type
 * has been specified as input to the document search.  This is because the customizer is tied to the document type and
 * the document search must therefore be able to resolve a valid document type from the user-supplied criteria in order
 * to perform these customizations.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since some of the operations on this component could potentially add expense to the overall search process in the
 * cases where customization is only done on certain document types or only certain customization features are being
 * utilized, this interface provides for a set of boolean operations which indicate which customization
 * features should be activated by the document search framework for a given document type.  It's expected that KEW
 * will check each of these flags prior to invoking the corresponding method that it "gaurds" and, if the customization
 * flag is disabled, it should refrain from executing that method.</p>
 *
 * <p></p>Implementations of this interface are expected to return "true" for any of these operations for which they
 * provide a custom implementation.  <strong>It is important to note that callers are permitted to cache the results
 * returned from these boolean methods for an unspecified length of time.</strong>  So if there is any possibility that,
 * for a given document type, the implementation might perform a particular customization, then "true" should be
 * returned from the appropriate boolean method.</p>
