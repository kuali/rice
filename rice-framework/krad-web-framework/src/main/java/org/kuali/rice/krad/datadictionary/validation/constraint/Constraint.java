/**
 * This is the marker interface for constraints. Constraints are a central concept in the Rice data dictionary
 * validation, and are the
 * primary mechanism by which the validation of an object or one of its attributes takes place. For example, by
 * imposing
 * a length constraint
 * on an attribute of a business object, it's possible to indicate that only values shorter (or longer) than a specific
 * number of characters
 * are valid for that attribute.
 *
 * Any interface that extends Constraint is by definition a constraint, and may have one of the following defined:
 *
 * - A sub-interface for {@link Constrainable} that advises on how a constraint maps to data dictionary metadata
 * - A {@link ConstraintProvider} that looks up constraints for a specific constrainable definition
 * - A {@link ConstraintProcessor} that processes the constraint against some object value to determine if it is valid
