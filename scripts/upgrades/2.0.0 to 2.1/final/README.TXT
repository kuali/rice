/*  What changed from the original upgrade scripts?   */
/******************************************************/

    1. Demo and sample tables were removed from the scripts, along with any corresponding data.

    2. Any temp tables that used to be created & dropped as part of the upgrade are now dropped in cleanup_final_*.sql

    3. For KRIM table unique identifiers, the id that will be used is the next highest number in the table under
       10,000.  For Example, if ids 1, 2, 6, 10001, KFS123, and KC34 exist in KRIM_PERM_T, The next row created via
       the upgrade scripts will have an id of 7.
