/**
 * <p>Interface which abstracts a piece of information ("attribute") associated with

 * <p>WorkflowAttribute lifecycle:</p>
 * <p>Definition via XML</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Attribute definition is defined in XML (... any actions that are performed on-definition)</li>
 *   <li>Attribute definition is registered in a Rule Template definition in XML</li>
 *   <li>Rule Template is associated with a Document and a Rule in XML</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Definition via UI (this documentation needs work)</p>
 * <ol>

 *   <li>{@link #validateRuleData(Map)} and {@link #validateRoutingData(Map)} and are called to validate the configuration/extension values
 *       of the rule definition, and the user-configured rule data (??). see {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.rule.web.WebRuleBaseValues},
 *       {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.rule.RuleRoutingAttribute}.</li>
 *   <li>Not sure where and why these are called, or how that is reconciled with XML-based ingestion....?  The 'required' field only seems
 *       to matter with regard to these two methods; it seems to only ever be used in implementations of these two methods</li> 
 * </ol>
 * <p>Runtime evaluation</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Client application constructs {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.api.document.attribute.WorkflowAttributeDefinition} and attaches
 *       it to the client-side document</li>
 *   <li>Upon action taken on the document, the Attributes that are described by the <code>WorkflowAttributeDefinitionVO</code>s
 *       are looked up (... how ...) and constructed on the client side.</li>
 *   <li>If the attribute is a {@link WorkflowAttributeXmlValidator} (e.g. {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.rule.xmlrouting.StandardGenericXMLRuleAttribute}),
 *       then {@link WorkflowAttributeXmlValidator#validateClientRoutingData()} is called to validate any data the client app may have set
 *       on the client-instantiated attribute (the {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.api.document.attribute.WorkflowAttributeDefinition})</li>
 *   <li>Attribute content (content the attribute generates to place in the eDoc document content) is obtained from the attribute
 *       via {@link WorkflowRuleAttribute#getDocContent()} or {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.framework.document.attribute.SearchableAttribute#generateSearchContent(org.kuali.rice.kew.api.extension.ExtensionDefinition, String, org.kuali.rice.kew.api.document.attribute.WorkflowAttributeDefinition)},
 *       depending on whether the attribute is a WorkflowAttribute or {@link org.kuali.rice.kew.framework.document.attribute.SearchableAttribute}</li>
 *   <li>When a Rule is invoked (for instance, when a <code>requests</code> node is fired), all attributes associated with the rule
 *       (those associated with the Rule Template associated with the rule) which are WorkflowAttributes are enumerated and for each:
 *       <ol>
 *         <li>A special case is made for attributes defined in XML as
 *             of "RuleXmlAttribute" type ({@link KewApiConstants#RULE_XML_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE}): the attribute is cast to {@link GenericXMLRuleAttribute}
 *             and RuleAttribute business object is set on it ({@link GenericXMLRuleAttribute#setRuleAttribute(org.kuali.rice.kew.rule.RuleAttribute)}
 *             before proceeding with isMatch invocation. (what about a RuleAttributeAware interface so this can be done generically for all worklfow attribute
 *             implementations?)</li>
 *         <li>{@link WorkflowRuleAttribute#isMatch(DocumentContent, List)} is called with the Rule's extension values passed</li>

     * Each Row contains Fields describing the UI-level presentation of a single RuleExtensionValue.
     * <p>
     * A single Row may contain more than one actual Field instance, but Fields beyond the first one
     * are there to provide context for the display and evaluation of the first one.
     * 
     * <p>The getRuleRows method returns a list of rows that contain Fields describing the UI-level presentation of a single RuleExtensionValue for the creation of a rule.
     * A single row may contain more than one actual Field object, but Fields beyond the first one are there to provide context for the display and evaluation of the first one.
     * For example, a secondary field may be a lookupable or a searchable valid values object. An individual field consists of a field label, a field help url, a field type,
     * whether a lookupable is associated with this field, a property name, a property value, valid values, the name of the lookupable, and the default lookupable name for this field.
     * The field label is a short title that will display on the jsp describing what data to enter for this field. The field help url is optional, but will pop open in a new window
     * the url entered. The field type is the type of field to display (e.g. hidden, text, drop down, radio, quickfinder (lookupable), lookup result only (this type is needed for
     * the lookupable, but does not actually render on the jsp), and finally drop down refresh (this type is a drop down box that when it's value changes another drop down box's
     * valid values will be changed as well)). The lookupable indicator determines whether this field will have a lookupable (valid value search) associated with it. The property
     * name is the name of the field when rendered on the jsp. This needs to be unique when compared to other field names on the jsp. The property value is the value entered into
     * the text box or other field type on the jsp. This value will be empty when creating the field and populated during form submission. A List of valid values is optional and
     * needed to populate drop down boxes or radio buttons. This list consists of KeyValue objects which the key will be the value passed in on submission and the label will
     * be what is display on the jsp. The lookupable is the name of the lookable service to be called for this field. The default lookupable name is the name of the field on the
     * lookupable itself. This may be the same of the property name of the field. This is needed when field conversions are needed. If the lookupable returns a key that doesn't
     * match a property name on the jsp it needs to be converted to one that does. So if the property name is different than the default lookupable name, the lookupable will
     * convert the return key to the property name of the field. Example: say by default a lookupable returns "color=red" on the url. The default lookupable name would be "color"
     * and if you needed a different name for this property on the jsp such as "wallcolor", the lookupable will now return "wallcolor=red" instead of the default "color=red". The
     * default lookupable name also is the key for rule extension values. When an extension value is saved the value comes from the UI and the key from this field. If this field
     * is left null, then the property name of the field will become the key stored in the database for the extension value. A row can also consist of a group label and number
     * of rows for this label to span for this attribute. If a group label is present, it will display on the rule creation jsp and group together the individual rows for this
     * attribute. The total rows number will rowspan the group label across the rows of this attribute.
     * NOTE: the group label and number of rows to span must be specified on each row object for the display to work correctly.
     * 
     * <p>Additionally, it is very important that the List of Row objects is reconstructed every time getRuleRows is called.  This is because the code which processes
     * these Rows will set the propertyValue directly on the Field objects contained within.  Essentially, this means the Rows and Fields should not be constructed once inside of
     * the attribute and cached statically, but instead be recreated each time this method is called.
