/**

 * The transform will applied to the input yielding either a same or different typed output.  Normally, these are either
 * {@link Predicate}s or {@link QueryByCriteria}.  If the input does not need to be transformed then the function can
 * return the incoming argument.  This is a way to add, change, or remove inputs before or after query execution.  If
 * the input should be removed, the transform should return null.  The classic use of {@code Transform}s are to allow a
 * predicate referencing a property path that does not exist on a database mapped object to be changed to something that
 * is valid.
