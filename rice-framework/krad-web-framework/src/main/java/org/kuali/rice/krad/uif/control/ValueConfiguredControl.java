/**
 * Indicates <code>Control</code> types that can be configured with a static value to submit, as opposed to pulling
 * the value from the underlying property
 *
 * <p>
 * Examples of this are {@link CheckboxControl}, which can be configured with a value that will be submitted when the
 * checkbox is checked. For example, suppose we had a model property of type Set<String> that represents selected car
 * types. In the UI, we can present a list of available car types with a checkbox next to each. The value for the
 * each checkbox will be the model type of the associated role: 'Ford', 'GM', 'Honda'. For each checkbox selected the
 * associated value will be submitted and populated into the Set<String> on the model.
