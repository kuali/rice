 *
 * <p>
 * It locates this via a call to {@link org.kuali.rice.core.framework.persistence.jta.Jta#getTransactionManager()}.  So
 * the application must ensure that it has configured and setup JTA properly within it's application environment.

 * The superclass for this class, which is part of EclipseLink, attempts to invoke the
 * {@link #acquireTransactionManager()} from the default contructor. So an attempt will be made to acquire the JTA
 * transaction manager as soon as an instance of this object is created. This means that it must be ensured that JPA is
 * enabled prior to the creation of an instance of this controller class.
