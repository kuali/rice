        <title>Kuali Rice 2.0 Overview</title>
        <para>Welcome to Kuali Rice version 2.0!</para>
        <para>This is the first major release of the Kuali Rice software since version 1.0 which was
            released in August of 2009. This release brings many new and exciting features and
            improvements to the Kuali Rice middleware and application development platforms. </para>
        <para>The primary architectural goal for this release of Rice was to position the platform
            for cross-version service compatibility moving forward. With the increase in the number
            of applications (both internal and external to Kuali) that are integrating with the
            Kuali Rice middleware platform, the ability to provide for compatibility across
            different versions of Kuali Rice has risen to the forefront within the community as a
            critical need. The end result is intended to be a platform on which institutions can
            build applications without worrying about major forced upgrade paths for all integrated
            applications whenever they deploy a new release of Kuali Rice.</para>
        <para>Another major effort that was undertaken in support of compatibility work was an
            effort to improve the modularity of the various components of Kuali Rice. In version
            1.0.x of Rice, a high degree of coupling was present in numerous places. Work was done
            as part of this release to help improve upon that situation.</para>
        <para>In addition to the architectural efforts supporting compatibility and modularity,
            Kuali Rice 2.0 sees the introduction of two new major modules.</para>
        <para>The first of these is the Kuali Rapid Application Development (KRAD) module. KRAD is
            meant to provide the next generation of application development capabilities to those
            who are building applications based on Kuali software. KRAD provides a platform that can
            be utilized to build enterprise applications in a way that provides a more rich and
            flexible user experience than could be provided with the existing Kuali Nervous System
            (KNS). In fact, KRAD is intended to be the eventual replacement for the KNS which is the
            platform upon which much of the existing Kuali application software has been written.
            Note, however, that KNS is not being removed as of Rice 2.0. Work will continue on KRAD
            past the 2.0 release of Kuali Rice.</para>
        <para>The final major piece of functionality that was undertaken for this release was the
            introduction of the Kuali Rule Management System (KRMS). KRMS is a business rule
            management system which can be used to author and maintain business rules that can be
            utilized during decision making processes within an application. This includes the
            ability to use business rules defined in KRMS to define rules for workflow routing,
            notification, validation, and other custom scenarios.</para>
        <para>More details on each of the major efforts can be found in later sections of this
            document.</para>

        <title>Major Changes</title>
        <para>As mentioned in the overview and highlights, there were many major changes that were
            made in support of the goals of the Rice 2.0 release. During the implementation of
            modularity and version compatibility changes, there were many structural improvements
            and refactoring changes to Rice that are intended to help set a stronger foundation for
            future releases. Additionally, the KRMS and KRAD modules brought a large amount of new
            functionality to the Kuali Rice platform. These next sections dive into these changes in
            more detail.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Middleware Version Compatibility</title>
            <para>In Rice 2.0, we are providing what we call "middleware" or "service"
                compatibility. This type of compatibility is mainly concerned with compatibility
                between a client application and the version of the Kuali Rice standalone server
                with which it is integrated. The basic requirement here is that if the Kuali Rice
                standalone server (which hosts all of the Kuali Rice services) is upgraded to a new
                version, that should not force any applications that integrate with those services
                to also upgrade (unless the server has been upgraded to a new "major" version such
                as Rice 3.0, 4.0, etc.). It should be able to continue to interoperate with the new
                set of services without having to pull in new Kuali Rice client libraries or (in the
                case of manual web-service integration) it should not have to modify the way in
                which it invokes and handles remote service calls.</para>
            <para>The image below shows what the target is for version compatibility from the
                perspective of major, minor, and patch releases of Kuali Rice.</para>
            <para><inlinemediaobject>
                    <imageobject>

                    </imageobject>
                </inlinemediaobject></para>
            <para>The type of compatibility being implemented for version 2.0 is in contrast to what
                we call "framework" compatibility, or the ability to upgrade a client application to
                a new version of the Kuali Rice client libraries or development framework without
                having to make any forced changes to that client application. Those who use Java are
                familiar with this type of compatibility because that is the level of compatibility
                that is generally provided between releases of the JDK (this is sometimes called a
                "drop-in" replacement). Working toward a goal of framework compatibility is on the
                roadmap for the Kuali Rice project, however the Rice 2.0 release makes no guarantees
                that it will provide such a level of compatibility moving forward.</para>
            <para>More info on this and also Framework Version Compatibility can be found in our
                    <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="https://wiki.kuali.org/x/OABHC">Kuali Rice Version
                    Compatibility Statement</link>.</para>
            <para>The following sub-sections will delve into some specific work that was done in
                support of version compatibility.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Migration to SOAP web services</title>
                <para>In Kuali Rice 1.0.x, services based on Java serialization were the primary
                    services used for integration between Kuali Rice and client applications. The
                    mechanism by which serialization was performed used Spring's HTTP invoker
                    remoting framework. Java serialization is convenient for Java-to-Java
                    application interaction. However, a SOAP web service approach allows for a
                    greater level of interoperability between applications, including those not
                    written in Java. Additionally, serialization can sometimes inherently cause
                    compatibility issues when attempting to communicate between applications which
                    might be running different versions of Java or different versions of
                    libraries.</para>
                <para>To this end, the services in Rice 2.0 have all been reimplemented as
                    SOAP-based web services. There will be no Java-serialization based service
                    distributed with Kuali Rice 2.0. However, the Kuali Service Bus will still
                    support publishing of services that use Java. As part of this effort, the team
                    has taken care to carefully design the message formats such that:<itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The "required" portions of the message format are
                                well-defined</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The proper format of data in the messages in well-defined</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>Error and exception cases are well-defined</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The services are designed to allow for safe evolution over
                                time</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The services are namespaced and named appropriately</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The services are versioned appropriately</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>There is consistency in how services are designed and
                                documented</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>Much of the above information can be found in the WSDL's which
                    are generated for each of the services. The WSDL defines the message formats,
                    operations, and error conditions of the numerous Kuali Rice services. This
                    effort of service refactoring is at the heart of what we are calling "version
                    compatibility" for the Kuali Rice 2.0 release.</para>
                <para>Note that while SOAP is being used as the primary way in which services are
                    exposed in Rice 2.0, there will likely be work in the future to make services
                    available using the REST architectural style.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Kuali Service Bus</title>
                <para>In order to support requirements for version compatibility, there were
                    numerous changes that needed to be made to the Kuali Service Bus. This
                    ultimately resulted in a reworking of much of the internals of the KSB (with the
                    exception of it's messaging functionality). The major changes made to the KSB
                    for Kuali Rice 2.0 were:<orderedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Client applications now connect to the service registry through a

                                access for non-Java applications to interact with the service

                <title>Parameter Service, Namespace Service, and Component Service</title>
                <para>In Rice 1.0.x, parameters, namespaces, and components were part of the KNS
                    module of Rice. Client applications would access tables in the Kuali Rice server
                    database directory in order to read and write values from these tables. As part
                    of the general effort to modularize the Rice platform, it was decided that these
                    three concepts were core concepts since they were used outside of the pure
                    application development domain of the KNS (parameters in particular are used all
                    over the Kuali Rice codebase). To this end they were moved to the newly
                    established "core" module of Rice (see more information on modularity work in
                    later sections).</para>
                <para>Additionally, SOAP services were created for each of these to eliminate the
                    need for a client application to directly communicate with the related database
                    tables, instead using a service-oriented approach to interacting with these
                    different information sources. This resulted in the creation of the following services:<itemizedlist>

                    RiceApplicationConfigurationService in Rice 1.0.x. It uses a push model in
                    contrast to the pull model which was used in Rice 1.0.x.</para>

                <title>General Purpose Lookup APIs</title>
                <para>In Rice 1.0.x, may of the services (particularly the KIM services) had
                    general-purpose lookup methods which took a <code>Map&lt;String, String></code>.
                    In this map, the key was intended to represent the property name on the data
                    element being looked up and the value was intended to be the value to search
                    for. The value itself could contain various wild card characters and other
                    operators to allow for the construction of more complex searches. However, there
                    were a few inadequacies with this approach:<orderedlist>

                                how to implement the lookup according to the values passed

                    workflow were performed as well. The major changes made to the workflow services

                            <para>The new document search framework uses the

                                contrast to Rice 1.0.x where KNS <code>Row</code> and
                                    <code>Field</code> objects were transmitted using Java
                                serialization. This old model did not translate well to SOAP-based
                                services and had numerous other problems as well (namely that not
                                all of <code>Field</code> and <code>Row</code> was properly
                                serializable or could be interpreted correctly by the Rice

                <title>Caching Architecture</title>
                <para>In Rice 1.0.x, caching was implemented using a framework called OSCache along
                    with distributed caching flushing behavior across the KSB. This worked well in
                    general, however this setup was plagued by issues of far too many cache-related
                    message events getting generated and sent. Additionally, OSCache is a long-dead
                    project which has not had any activity in a long time. In order to ensure that
                    Kuali Rice was positioned for service compatibility moving forward, an effort
                    was undertaken to revamp and update the caching architecture utilized by the
                    Rice platform and find a better and more sustainable solution.</para>
                <para>The result is a solution based on the caching abstraction provided with the
                    core Spring framework version 3.1. The backend caching implementation being used
                    is Ehcache (which is the default recommended by Spring). There is a also
                    integration with the Kuali Service Bus for sending cache eviction messages out
                    to interested listeners. This allows us to keep our caching consistent across
                    different applications in an enterprise architecture which has been integrated
                    with Kuali Rice.</para>

            <title>Modularity</title>
            <para>In version 1.0.x of Kuali Rice, the software was divided into 3 main modules: api,
                impl, and web. While this was convenient from the development perspective, it
                resulted in a high level of coupling between the various "logical" modules of Rice
                (the core, kew, kim, ksb, etc.). Attempts were made to rectify some of these issues
                in Kuali Rice 2.0. Since the full vision for modularity in Kuali Rice was not in
                scope for the 2.0 release, as much work was done on modularity as could be permitted
                in order help reach version compatibility goals for the release.</para>
            <para>Primarily, this included the creation of numerous "api" and "framework" modules
                and the partitioning of Kuali Rice into various sub-project modules. This structure
                can be seen when looking at the source code for Rice 2.0. The design and vision for
                modularity in Kuali Rice can be found at the following links:</para>

            <section>
                <title>Core PeopleFlow concept</title>
                <para>A new concept was added to Kuali Enterprise Workflow as part of workflow
                    routing requirements for Kuali Coeus. The requirement was essentially to
                    replicate the functionality of "Maps" in the existing Coeus system upon which
                    Kuali Coeus is based. These maps are simply lists of people or roles who can
                    approve in a particular order. This order is defined by a series of "stops". At
                    each stop there can be a number of possible approvers which may have
                    delegates.</para>
                <para>There was not really an equivalent concept in KEW today, this is essentially
                    like a mini-workflow itself. So the concept of PeopleFlows were added along with
                    a new activation type called "Priority-Parallel" activation. This
                    priority-parallel activation allows for action requests to be activated at a
                    node in parallel if they have the same priority, but in sequence if they have
                    different priority values.</para>
                <para>Further details on the implementation of PeopleFlows, their lineage in Coeus,
                    as well as some screenshots of the maintenance user interface can be found here:

                <para>The previous section introduced the concept of PeopleFlows. The KRMS module
                    will have integration with PeopleFlows built in through the use of a custom type
                    of "Action". This action will allow a rule author to build a business rule and
                    then indicate that the action that should be executed if the rule succeeds would
                    be to route to the specified PeopleFlow.</para>

                <title>Kuali Rapid Application Development Framework (KRAD)</title>
                <para>KRAD (Kuali Rapid Application Development) is a framework that eases the
                    development of enterprise web applications by providing reusable solutions and
                    tooling that enable developers to build in a rapid and agile fashion. KRAD is a
                    complete framework for web development that provides infrastructure in all major
                    areas of an application (client, business, and data) and integrates with other
                    modules of the Rice middleware project. KRAD is the next generation of the Rice
                    Kuali Nervous System (KNS) and Kuali Student development frameworks. It expands
                    on the ability to rapidly create user interfaces with XML while providing more
                    flexibility with layouts and user experience. In addition, KRAD allows for the
                    creation of modern, rich user interfaces using the jQuery and Fluid frameworks. </para>

                <para>KRMS (Kuali Rule Management System) is a new module in Rice that enables the
                    externalization of pieces of business logic (rules) from an application such
                    that it is customizable without need for additional client programming. Agendas
                    containing custom business rules can be defined, edited and stored in the
                    repository, and then executed by the application against some set of information
                    (facts).</para>
                <para>There is also integration between KRMS and KEW's new PeopleFlow concept that
                    enables invocation of the rule execution engine from within a workflow. Rules

            <title>Upgrade Considerations</title>
            <para>This section outlines the process of upgrading from Rice 1.0.3.3 to Rice 2.0.0.
                If you are curently running an older version of the 1.0.x code, you will need to
                perform the steps to upgrade to 1.0.3.3 first.</para>
            <para>In terms of upgrading to Kuali Rice 2.0, there are two main types of upgrades
                which will typically need to be performed:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Kuali Rice Standalone Server</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Client Applications</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>Since Rice 2.0 is not backward compatible with 1.0.x, upgrades to
                both the standalone server and any client applications who are using the Rice APIs
                will need to be coordinated to occur at the same time.</para>
            <para>It is likely that an institution which has built multiple custom Kuali Rice
                applications will need to perform both of these steps and coordinate the upgrade
                appropriately within their enterprise.  For the other Kuali applications within the
                Kuali Foundation, each of the projects are planning forthcoming releases which will
                support Rice 2.0.  So it would be advisable to wait until those upgraded versions
                are available before taking on an enterprise-wide upgrade of Kuali Rice
                infrastructure to avoid needing to manually convert these applications yourself.
                Please consult the timelines of the other Kuali projects for details on their
                planned upgrade to Rice 2.0.</para>
            <para>For those applications which are running Kuali Rice in "Bundled" mode (which means
                the application is not dependant on a seperate Kuali Rice Standalone Server
                instance) then both types of upgrades will need to be performed on the same
                application.</para>
            <para>In addition to upgrading the Rice standalone server and any integrated client
                applications, any use of the Kuali Rice data in downstream systems (such as a Data
                Warehouse or reporting environment) needs to be considered.  There have been
                impacting changes to the Rice database tables as part of development on version 2.0.
                Therefore, existing reports may not work as desired and should be updated and tested
                appropriately.</para>
            <para>In the following sections, we will describe the upgrade process for each of the
                different areas in detail.</para>

            <title>Upgrading a Kuali Rice Standalone Server</title>
            <para>The Kuali Rice Standalone Server is made available as a WAR and deployed to a
                servlet container (typically Tomcat). The general process for upgrading a standalone
                server from version 1.0.3.3 to version 2.0 will be as follows:<orderedlist>

                <title>Re-apply Local Customizations</title>
                <para>Many who have implemented Kuali Rice have performed local customizations to
                    the software.  This might include patching bugs, adding additional features, or
                    overriding reference service implementations (especially in the case of Kuali
                    Identity Management).  Additionally, customization may have been done to some of
                    the web content that's included as part of the KNS framework.</para>
                <para>It is, of course, important that these local customizations be reapplied to
                    your Kuali Rice 2.0 implementation as part of your upgrade process.  You may be
                    accomplishing this in many different ways, the most common approaches include
                    the following:<itemizedlist>

                    </itemizedlist>Regardless of the approach or approaches you are utilizing, it's
                    important to ensure your customizations are transfered properly.  The code base
                    of Kuali Rice has changed significantly during the 2.0 work.  As a result, it's
                    suggested that you port over any code or file customizations one class at a time
                    to ensure they get rewritten if needed to link and compile properly with the 2.0
                    libraries.</para>

                <title>Upgrade Workflow Plugins</title>
                <para>If your Rice server is loading any KEW plugins, then these will need to be
                    upgraded as well.  At the very least, this will likely involve recompilation and
                    repackaging to link with the Rice 2.0 apis.  Depending on how much code is in
                    the plugin and which Rice frameworks it utilizes, it's likely that plugin code
                    will need to be upgraded in a similar fashion to client application code in
                    order for it to work properly within the Rice plugin framework.  See the Client
                    Application portion of the upgrade guide for more information on this.</para>

                            <code>KRIM_PERM_T</code> and <code>KRIM_RSP_T</code> tables must be
                        unique within each one of these tables.</para>
                    <para>The "final" upgrade scripts that are provided with the upgrade add the

                        the upgrade from failing, it's important to ensure the data in these tables
                        conforms to the new uniqueness constraints before they are applied to the

                <title>Update Configuration</title>
                <para>The most frequently customized configuration parameters which are used by the
                    standalone server have not changed a whole lot between Rice 1.0.x and 2.0.
                    However there are a few changes which are important to note.</para>
                <para>First of all, in Rice 1.0.x there was a configuration parameter named
                        <code>rice.additionalSpringFiles</code>.  This was used to load custom
                    Spring files into the standalone server (or a client application) which could be
                    used to override internal Kuali Rice services for the purposes of customization.
                    In Rice 2.0, there is no longer a single <code>rice.additionalSpringFiles</code>
                    parameter.  Instead there is one per module of Rice such as
                        <code>rice.kew.additionalSpringFiles</code>,
                        <code>rice.ksb.additionalSpringFiles</code>,
                        <code>rice.kim.additionalSpringFiles</code>, etc.  When re-applying and
                    loading customizations, this needs to be taken into account.  Additionally, you
                    will need to ensure you are overriding the server in the appropriate module or
                    else the service override will not take effect.</para>
                <para>Additionally, the caching implementation for Rice has been reworked to use the
                    Ehcache library.  As a result, the various kim.cache.* configuration parameters
                    are no longer available.  Instead, when needing to customize how caching for KIM
                    (or any other module of Rice) is configured, a custom ehcache configuration file
                    can be loaded through configuration parameters like
                        <code>kim.ehcache.config.location</code>,
                        <code>kew.ehcache.config.location</code>, etc.</para>
                <para>Generally speaking, for configuration parameters which you are using and
                    overriding as part of your standalone server setup, it's best to look at the
                    value in the configuration defaults for Rice to determine if or how it has
                    changed in Rice 2.0.  The source for that configuration default file can be

                    in Rice 1.0.x. However, in Rice 2.0, Tomcat 6 or Tomcat 7 is recommended. It is
                    not recommended to run the Kuali Rice Standalone Server in Tomcat 5.5.x as was
                    the case with Rice 1.0.x.</para>

                <title>Client Database Upgrade</title>
                <para>While there were not a lot of database changes made to the database tables
                    that a Kuali Rice client application uses, there were a few. Those changes are
                    fairly minor, however, and can be summarized as follows:<orderedlist>

                        </listitem>
                    </orderedlist>Those are the only structural changes which need to be made to
                    existing client application databases. MySQL and Oracle scripts for performing
                    these updates are available in the following locations in the Rice distribution downloads:<variablelist>

                <para>As <link linkend="library_changes_and_additions">mentioned previously</link>,
                    there have been numerious 3rd-party dependency updates in this version of Rice.
                    Additionally, modularity work done during this release that results in a more
                    granular set of Rice libraries. All of these library dependencies are included
                    with the binary distribution of Kuali Rice. Additionally, if an application is
                    using Maven, all of the Rice dependencies are available in the Maven Central
                    Repository under the <code>org.kuali.rice</code> group id: <link

                <para>Details on the library changes will be outlined in the next few sections. You
                    will need to update the libraries associated with your existing project as
                    necessary in order to react to this.  What follows are tables detailing
                    libraries added, removed, and changed from Rice 1.0.3.3 to Rice 2.0.  In
                    addition to this information, detailed dependency analysis can be found on the

                            sure to verify whether or not you are using a particular library in your
                            application independently of Rice before you remove it from your

                    <title>Kuali Rice Libraries</title>
                    <para>In Rice 1.0.x, there were only two main jars, <code>rice-api</code> and
                            <code>rice-impl</code>. With the modularity work there are more api jars
                        corresponding to service apis and framework components. Additionally, the
                        implementation module has been split (though there is still a shared
                        implementation module as not all components of the Rice implementation have
                        been fully modularized as of the Rice 2.0.0 release). This work was done
                        according to the design outlined at the following page: <link

Spring MVC can be found in 'spring-webmvc.jar' and 'spring-webmvc-portlet.jar' in the lib/modules directory of the distribution. Furthermore, the Struts 1.x support has been factored out into 'spring-webmvc-struts.jar'.

                <title>Web Content Changes</title>
                <para>For applications which are using the KNS, some of the web content has changed.
                    This web content includes images, javascript, css, jsp, and tag library files.
                    When using the KNS these are typically copied into the application.  Therefore
                    when performing an upgrade, the original KNS web content should be deleted from
                    the project and the new web content from Rice 2.0.0 should be copied into it's
                    place.</para>
                <para><emphasis>However</emphasis>, if the client application has made
                    customizations to any of these resources then they will need to manually reapply
                    any customizations they have made.  In order to aid in this process, information

                <title>Rice Configurer Changes</title>
                <para>Previously, all module configuration was done via a class wired in Spring
                    called the <code>RiceConfigurer</code>. This has been replaced by a modular
                    configuration design, with the rice core being configured in a new
                        <code>CoreConfigurer</code>. Each module has it's own configurer as well
                        (<code>KEWConfigurer</code>, <code>KIMConfigurer</code>, etc..). Run modes
                    are set independently for each module and additional spring files are now
                    defined on a per-module basis as discussed in the standalone server upgrade
                    portion of this document.</para>
                <para>An example Spring configuration which would load all of the available Rice
                    modules into a client app would look like the

                <para>For the example above, most all of these modules would be running in the
                    REMOTE run mode.  That is the default with the exception of CoreConfigurer and
                    KRADConfigurer which always run in LOCAL module and don't have a REMOTE run
                    mode.  It's important in these cases to load the Rice
                        <code>common-config-defaults.xml</code> file into your configuration context
                    so that the appropriate defaults can be applied.</para>
                <para>The following example shows doing this as well as switching the KIM and KEW
                    run modes to "embedded"
                    mode:<programlisting>&lt;config>

  &lt;param name="kim.mode">EMBEDDED&lt;/param>
  ...
&lt;/config></programlisting>Note
                    that if you were in fact configuring KEW and KIM for embedded mode you would
                    also need to inject a <emphasis>serverDataSource</emphasis> into the
                        <code>CoreConfigurer</code> which would point to your Kuali Rice Standalone

            <para>If you have written any reports against your Kuali Rice database tables, they may
                need to be updated to reflect changes to the database tables in version 2.0.
                Generally speaking, the changes to database tables is not extensive, but here is a
                summary of some of the significant changes that have been made:<orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The <code>DOC_HDR_ID</code> and other numeric identifiers in the
                                <code>KREW_*</code> tables have been changed to <code>VARCHAR</code>
                            datatypes.  This facilitates more flexibility in the kind of data which
                            can be stored in these tables and brings the KEW tables in line with
                            other tables in Kuali Rice.</para>
