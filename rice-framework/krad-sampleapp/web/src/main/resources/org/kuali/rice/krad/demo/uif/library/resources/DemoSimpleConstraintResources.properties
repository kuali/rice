@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraintView}#componentName=Simple Constraint
@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraintView}#page.instructionalText=The SimpleConstraint object stores constraints that are consider "simple" \
  for an InputField.  There are 2 ways to set SimpleConstraint values - through a property directly on InputField or \
  by setting the SimpleConstraint bean directly (ALWAYS overrides all SimpleConstraint properties, when set).  Both are \
  demonstrated in examples/code below.

@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example1}#headerText=Required
@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example1}#instructionalText=The required property set to true means this field is required to \
  have content filled in by the user.  Interact with field to see client-side validation behavior for this constraint.

@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example2}#headerText=Min/Max Length
@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example2}#instructionalText=The minLength and maxLength settings are used to constrain length of \
  the value entered

@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example3}#headerText=Min/Max Value
@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example3}#instructionalText=The exclusiveMin and inclusiveMax are used to constrain what the \
  minimum and maximum value of a numeric field can be

@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example4}#headerText=DataType
@cmp{Demo-SimpleConstraint-Example4}#instructionalText=Used to constrain what DataType values must be convertible to. \
  This constraint can only be processed server side - click the button to validate entries.
