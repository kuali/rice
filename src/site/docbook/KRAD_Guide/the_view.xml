    <title>The View </title>
    <section>
        <title>Putting It Together with Views </title>
        <section>
            <title>The View Component</title>
            <para>The view component sits at the very top of the component tree. It holds one or
                more pages that allow the user to complete a course grained task. In addition to the
                pages it holds, the view also contains the standard container header, footer, and
                errors fields. We also configure navigation for the pages through the view
                component.</para>
            <para>In addition to the interface related configuration, many properties exist on the
                view component for configuring backend processing. Some examples of this include the
                form post URL, the form (model) class, and validation flags.</para>
            <para>The base view component is defined with the class
                org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View. For views that need to render an HTML form, the
                subclass org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.FormView is used. The component beans we use
                to configure the view are 'Uif-View' and 'Uif-FormView'. The following is an example
                of configuring a form view:</para>
            <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">
&lt;bean id="Travel-testView1" parent="Uif-FormView"&gt;
    &lt;property name="title" value="Test View 1"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="items"&gt;
        &lt;list&gt;
            &lt;bean parent="Uif-Disclosure-Page" p:id="page1"&gt;
                &lt;property name="items"&gt;
                    &lt;list&gt;
                        &lt;ref bean="testSection1"/&gt;
                        &lt;ref bean="testSection2"/&gt;
                        &lt;ref bean="testSection3"/&gt;
                        &lt;ref bean="testSection4"/&gt;
                        &lt;ref bean="testSection5"/&gt;
                    &lt;/list&gt;
                &lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;/bean&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="formClass" value="edu.sampleu.travel.krad.form.UITestForm"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="defaultBindingObjectPath" value="travelAccount1"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
            </programlisting>    
            <para>In this example, we first set the title for the view (inherited from
                ContainerBase). Then, we configured one page in the view's items list that contains
                five sections. Finally, we associated the view with the form class 'UITestForm' and
                specify a default binding object path.</para>
            <para>The id given for the view component (either by explicitly setting the id property
                or through the bean id) is very important. For the case of general form view, this
                is how we will request the view with a URL (custom views that extend the general
                form view, known as view types, may support other ways of retrieving a view).</para>

                                <para>namespaceCode – Module (or application) namespace code the
                                view is associated with. If given, this will be used when making KIM
                                permissions checks (other future uses are planned as well)</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>viewName – A unique name for the view within a view type. View
                                types (covered in Chapter 13) support alternate ways of retrieving a
                                view. For example, a lookup view can be requested by passing the
                                data object class the lookup view is associated with. If multiple
                                lookup views exist for the same data object class, they can be
                                differentiated by using the viewName. The viewName is then passed
                                with the data object class through the URL. If the view name is not
                                specified, it inherits the name 'default'</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>theme – The ViewTheme object associated with the view. This
                                configures the base set of style sheets and script files that are
                                used for the rendered view</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>applicationHeader and applicationFooter – A Header element and
                                Group footer that will be rendered before and after the view
                                contents. This is used to define a consistent application header and
                                footer through all views (note most Rice applications currently use
                                the portal header and footer instead)</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>breadcrumbs – A Breadcrumbs widget used to provide application
                                crumbs. Note this provides the conceptial location of the view
                                within the application, not the 'trail', unless you are using
                                path-based breadcrumbs.</para>

                            <para>growls – Growls widget that can be used to configure growls that
                                are displayed for the view</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>growlMessagingEnabled – Enables or disables growl messages. If
                                enabled, growls will appear on refresh of a page when there are
                                error, warning, or informational messages. If disabled, growls can
                                still be given with the use of custom script</para>

                                page that should be opened for the initial request. If not
                                specified, the first page configured in the items list is
                                used</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>currentPageId – Id for the page to be rendered. In the controller
                                this property can be set to change the page that will be rendered.
                                The default navigate method provided in UifControllerBase takes care
                                of changing this value</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>navigation – The NavigationGroup that will be rendered for the
                                view</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>formClass – Full class name for the form (top level model object).
                                Note that it is not a requirement that the form class extends
                                UifFormBase, but it must implement the ViewModel interface</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>defaultBindingObjectPath – Default path to use for the binding
                                object path of DataBinding components. See ' Data Binding' in
                                Chapter 6</para>

                            <para>objectPathToConcreteClassMapping – A map of property paths to
                                class mappings. When a property has an abstract type (interface or
                                abstract class) it is not possible for the framework to create
                                instances of that class or, in many cases, find data dictionary or
                                persistence metadata. In these cases, a map entry can be added to
                                specify the concrete class to use</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>additionalScriptFiles – A list of script (.js) file paths (either
                                relative to the web root or full URLS) that should be included for
                                the rendered view</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>additionalCssFiles - A list of style (.css) file paths (either
                                relative to the web root or full URLS) that should be included for
                                the rendered view</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>viewTypeName – Name of the view type that the view belongs to.
                                This is generally set in the base beans for a view type (such as
                                'LOOKUP', or 'INQUIRY'). When requesting a view by type, this name
                                must be sent</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>viewHelperServiceClass – Full class name for the ViewHelperService
                                implementation. Defaults to
                                org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.service.impl.ViewHelperServiceImpl. Note you
                                may also inject the ViewHelperService instance by setting the
                                viewHelperService property</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>viewStatus – Lifecycle status for the view. This is generally just
                                used by the framework</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>viewIndex – A class the holds indexes for various view components.
                                This is used throughout the framework and custom code to retrieve
                                components. For example, suppose we wanted to find the InputField
                                for property 'field1' and we were given the view instance. Without
                                the index, we would need to traverse the component tree, looking for
                                InputField components, and then checking the property name. Using
                                the view index, we can simply get the InputField by the property
                                name with the contained index. The indexes are built while carrying
                                out the view lifecycle and traversing the tree for the phases</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>viewRequestParameters – A Map of request parameters that were used
                                to initialize the view component (see upcoming section 'View Request
                                Parameters'). These must be maintained on the form in the case of
                                view reinitialization (for example, in the case of a session
                                timeout)</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>presentationController – ViewPresentationController instance used
                                to perform logic for edit, read-only, and hidden states of
                                components</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>authorizer – ViewAuthorizer instance used to perform user based
                                authorization for a component's edit or view state</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>expressionVariables – A map of custom variables that can be used
                                in expressions. The map key gives the variable name, and the value
                                gives the expression to evaluate for the variable value. These are
                                evaluated at the beginning of the perform model phase, and then
                                available in any expression on the view's contained
                                components</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>singlePageView – Indicates whether the view only contains one page
                                group. In this case, the items configured are assumed to be section

        <title>Breadcrumbs</title>
        <para>Breadcrumbs represent where the view is located in the overall application structure.
            They give the user a way to navigate to "parent" views/urls that may be associated with
            your application and are related to the View itself.  Because different applications
            have the ability to build out various unique site structures with Krad, what appears in
            the breadcrumb trail for a View is highly configurable.  <figure>
                <title>Breadcrumbs Appearance</title>

                </mediaobject>
            </figure></para>
        <para>In the UI, Breadcrumbs are part of every View and appear at the very top of each View
            below the application's header and below the View's topGroup (if these are configured).
            By default, with no configuration, the breadcrumbs will contain a View breadcrumb, with
            the view title as determined by headerText of the View's header component and a page
            breadcrumb (also determined by its header's headerText).  If no title can be determined,
            the item is omitted from the trail.  In addition, by default, if there are zero or one
            breadcrumbs in the trail, the Breadcrumbs widget is omitted from the View.</para>
        <para>However, there are various ways to customize breadcrumbs beyond this default
            behavior.</para>
        <section>
            <title>BreadcrumbItem</title>
            <para>A BreadcrumbItem represents the label and the url for a breadcrumb that appears in
                the breadcrumbs trail.  Both View and PageGroup contain a BreadcrumbItem property
                called "breadcrumbItem".  As described above, the title and url of these
                BreadcrumbItems are determined automatically by Krad base beans and lifecycle
                methods, if not configured directly through xml.</para>
            <para>BreadcrumbItems contain the following properties:<table frame="all" pgwide="1"

            <para>For example, in most views, you would like breadcrumbs to appear
                    as: "Home > View1 > Page".  The only setup that needs to be done is to either
                    setup homewardPathBreadcrumbs with a home BreadcrumbItem or use the View's
                    ParentLocation pointing to a home url (because the "View1" and "Page"
                    breadcrumbs are automated if not configured).  
            </para>
            <para>Inorder to chose the appropriate mechanism to use in this scenario, it is up to
                your application needs, but if this View potentially links to another View, using
                ParentLocation would allow you to inherit the "Home" breadcrumb (if you make "View1"
                its parent) resulting in something like "Home > View1 > View2 > Page".  </para>
            <para>Alternatively, if your View bean parents from another base View bean defined in
                your project, every view in your project could inherit the homewardPathBreadcrumbs
                property from it. </para>
            <para>It is important to take into consideration how your application will setup its own
                breadcrumb structure to meet your project's application needs by taking these
                options and rendering order into account.</para>

        <title>Sticky Headers And Footers</title>
        <para>Specific headers and footers of the view can become "sticky" to always stay in the
            view when the user scrolls.  The page content will appear to scroll underneath these
            fixed portions.  If pieces of the header/footer are sticky and other pieces are not, it
            will appear that the non-sticky pieces are either collapsing out of view or expanding
            into View when the user scrolls the window.  This sticky functionality is useful to
            always keep information important to the application visible; such as navigation,
            document information, or buttons that perform actions on the current View (allowing the
            user to click buttons that would normally appear in a footer and require a user to
            scroll down to them when not sticky).</para>
        <para>Since this functionality is heavily css and style based, and is completely automated
            by the framework through javascript, it is not recommended that you change default
            styling related to width or positioning for the headers/footers you are attempting to
            make sticky in your application.  Keep in mind that sticky content must have a solid
            background color or pattern and remain a width of 100% to appear correctly to the
            user.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Sticky Header Options</title>
            <para>There are 4 main sections of the header content you can make sticky.  These are:
                application header, the View's topGroup, breadcrumbs, and the View's header.  These
                can be mixed and matched as needed for your application or View needs.  </para>
            <para>Important note:  The pattern (not sticky)-(sticky)-(not sticky)-(sticky) for
                header content is NOT ALLOWED; ie, two independent areas that "scroll collapse"
                offscreen are not allowed.</para>
            <para>The View has the following properties for controlling sticky header content: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>stickyApplicationHeader - make the application's header sticky </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>stickyTopGroup - make the View's custom topGroup (content appears
                            above breadcrumbs) content sticky</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>stickyBreadcrumbs - make the View's breadcrumbs sticky</para>

                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>To make the application header sticky, the following code on the View is
                used:<programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;property name="stickyApplicationHeader" value="true"/></programlisting></para>
            <para>For sticky View's

            <title>Sticky Footer Options</title>
            <para>There are 3 main sections of the View's footer you can make sticky.  These are:
                application footer, the View's footer, the current PageGroup's footer.  A common use
                case is to make the page or View's footer sticky to have buttons always available to
                the user without forcing the user to scroll to get to them.</para>
            <para>The View has the following properties for controlling sticky footer content: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>stickyFooter</para>

                        <para>stickyApplicationFooter</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>The PageGroup (page) also has the stickyFooter property, to make its footer
                sticky.</para>
            <para>The following code makes all footers sticky.  Note the usage of stickyFooter on
                each PageGroup item of the
                View:<programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">  &lt;bean id="Demo-StickyHeaderFooter-View9" parent="Demo-StickyHeaderFooter-BaseView">
    &lt;property name="items">

    &lt;/property>
    &lt;property name="stickyFooter" value="true"/>
    &lt;property name="stickyApplicationFooter" value="true"/>
  &lt;/bean></programlisting></para>
            <para>Like sticky header options, these options can be mixed and matched as needed per a
                View.</para>
