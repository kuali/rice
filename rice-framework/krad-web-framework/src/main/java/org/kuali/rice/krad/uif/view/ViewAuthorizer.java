     * <p>
     * Action flags are created for views to indicate some action or feature should be enabled. These flags can be
     * used within expressions for configuring the view content.
     *
     * For example:
     * <bean parent="Action" p:methodToCall="save" p:actionLabel="save"

     * For each action flag, KIM is consulted to determine if a permission exist for the template associated with

     * Returns the set of edit modes that are authorized for the given user
     *
     * <p>
     * An edit mode is a string that identifies a set of editable fields within the view. These are generally used
     * when the entire view is not editable, but only certain fields. A field can be associated with an edit mode in
     * two ways. The first is by using the edit mode in an expression when setting the field readOnly property.
     *
     * For example:
     * <property name="readOnly" value="@{!#editModes['specialEdit'] and !fullEdit}" />
     *
     * The second way is with the
     * {@link ViewPresentationController#canEditField(View, ViewModel, org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.field.Field, String)}
     * method which can look at the edit modes map on the view to determine if the given field should be editable.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * For each edit mode, KIM is consulted to determine if a permission exist for the 'Use View' template and
     * the edit mode detail. If so, a check is then made to determine if the user has that permission. If the
     * permission
     * fails for the user, the edit mode is removed from the returned set.
