/**
 * The {@code ServiceBus} is the primary api that client applications use to interact with the Kuali
 * Service Bus. It provides capabilities to retrieve services endpoints for use when needing to
 * invoke a service. It also provides a mechanism by which a client application can publish it's own
 * services to the bus.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The service bus may be backed by a service registry which can be used to locate services which
 * other applications have published to the service registry. The service bus will synchronize it's
 * known state with the of the registry, either through explicit invocations of the
 * {@link #synchronize()} method or on a periodic basis (the details of which are up to the
 * implementation).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@code ServiceBus} manages two primary collections of {@link Endpoint} classes.
 * Those that have been published by this application (referred to as "local" endpoints) and those
 * which have been published by other applications (referred to as "remote" endpoints).
