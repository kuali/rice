 * ConstraintProcessor must be implemented by constraint processors, which validate individual constraints in the

 * via dependency injection with a list of processors. This gives institutions the ability to easily modify how
 * validation
 * should be handled and to add arbitrary new constraints and constraint processors.</p>
 *
 * <p>An alternative might have been to put
 * the process() method into the Constraint marker interface and have each Constraint define its own processing, but
 * that would
 * have forced business logic into what are naturally API classes (classes that implement Constraint). This strategy
