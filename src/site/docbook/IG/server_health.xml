    <title>Monitoring Server Health</title>
    <para>Kuali Rice includes a server endpoint URL that provides an unathenticated API which can be
        used to check if a Kuali Rice server is healthy or not, as well as retrieving additional
        health metrics. </para>
    <section>
        <title>Health API Usage</title>
        <para>The health endpoint provides an API that can be used for either a simple ping or for
            retrieving a detailed representation of application metrics. The API is defined as
            follows:</para>
        <para><itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Ping</emphasis>: GET /{server base}/health </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Detail</emphasis>: GET/{server
                        base}/health?detail=true</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>"Ping" will return a 204 (No Content) response if successful and "Detail"
            will return a 200 (Ok) response if successful and include a JSON payload with health and
            metrics details.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Ping</title>
        <para>The Ping API can be used to validate if the Kuali Rice server is healthy and
            functional. It behaves as follows:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>If healthy, return a "204 No Content" HTTP status, with no response
                        body</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>If unhealthy, return a "503 Service Unavailable"</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>There is never any additional detail returned when simply pinging the
            health API, it is merely used to indicate whether or not the server is healthy. If
            additional detail is required, use the Detail API which will be described in the next
            section.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Detail</title>
        <para>The Detail API can be used to validate if the Kuali Rice server is healthy and
            functional as well as providing detailed metrics in a JSON response. These metrics can
            be useful in monitoring, debugging, and building graphs. It behaves as follows:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>If healthy, return a "200 Ok" HTTP status, the response body will include

                        body will include a JSON payload with detailed information, including a
                        message that indicates why the server might be unhealthy</para>

        <para>Note that for the various "usage" metrics, they will return a value between 0.0 and
            1.0 where 0.0 means 0% usage and 1.0 means 100% usage. So when configuring these
            threshold values, a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) should be used.</para>
        <para>There are defaults for each of the health check configuration parameters if they are
            not customized. The configuration parameters and their default values are listed below:<itemizedlist>
