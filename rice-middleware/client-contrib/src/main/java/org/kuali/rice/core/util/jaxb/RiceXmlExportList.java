/**
 * Custom subclass of AbstractList that, whenever the "get" method is called, will pass an
 * internally-stored list's object to the given listener for conversion into another object matching
 * the list's type. This allows for the marshalling process to discard generated items after they
 * have been marshalled.
 * 
 * <p>These lists are constructed by passing in another list containing the unconverted items,
 * as well as a listener that will create items of this list's type upon each invocation of
 * the "get" method.
 * 
 * <p>This is similar to the "streaming" unmarshalling strategy used in the RiceXmlImportList
 * class, except that this list has been adapted for marshalling instead.
 * 
 * @param E The type that the list is expected to return.
 * @param T The type that the list stores internally and passes to the listener for conversion as needed.
