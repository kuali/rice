/**
 * Defines methods common to all DataDictionaryDefinition types.
 *
 * DD: The highest level objects in the data dictionary are of
 * the following types:
 * BusinessObjectEntry
 * MaintenanceDocumentEntry
 * TransactionalDocumentEntry
 *
 * JSTL: The data dictionary is exposed as a Map which is accessed
 * by referring to the "DataDictionary" global constant.  This Map contains
 * the following kinds of entries keyed as indicated:
 * Business Object Entries -
 * Key = dataObjectClass name
 * Value = Map created by BusinessObjectEntryMapper
 * Maintenance Document entries -
 * Key = DocumentType name
 * Value = Map created by MaintenanceObjectEntryMapper
 * Transactional Document entries -
 * Key = DocumentType name
 * Value = Map created by TransactionalDocumentEntryMapper
 *
 * All elements are exposed to JSTL as Maps (where the element has a
 * unique key by which they can be retrieved), or Strings.  For collections
 * of elements having no unique key, the entry's position in the list
 * (0, 1, etc.) is used as its index.
 *
 * All Maps (except the top-level DataDictionary one) are guaranteed to
 * present their entries with an iteration order identical to the order
 * in which the elements were defined in XML.
