/**
 * A special type of attribute that is used exclusively for resolving abstract roles
 * to concrete responsibilities (users and groups).  A RoleAttribute provides resolution
 * for a set of abstract "role" names.  These are published via the {@link #getRoleNames()}
 * method, which returns a list of {@link RoleName}, which is a combination of class name (attribute implementation class),
 * abstract role name, and optional label and return url (DOCME: what is return url used for?).
 * 
 * <p>RoleAttribute lifecycle:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A RoleAttribute is defined on a Rule, via the <code>role</code> element, with the syntax:
 *       <i>fully qualified class name</i><b>!</b><i>abstract role name</i>. E.g.:<br/>
 *   <blockquote><code>&lt;role&gt;edu.whatever.attribute.SomeAttribute!RoleName&lt;/role&gt;</code></blockquote>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>When the <code>&lt;role&gt;</code> element is parsed, the Rule's "responsibility" is set to the role element value
 *       and the responsibility is marked to indicate that it is a role ("R", {@link KewApiConstants#RULE_RESPONSIBILITY_ROLE_ID})</li>
 *   <li>When a Rule that is configured with a Role responsibility is fired, {@link #getQualifiedRoleNames(String, DocumentContent)}
 *       is called to return a list of "qualified" role names.  Qualified role names are role names which have been qualified
 *       with some relevant contextual information (e.g. from the document) that is useful for subsequent responsibility
 *       resolution.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #resolveQualifiedRole(RouteContext, String, String)} is immediately called for each of the qualified role names
 *       returned in the previous step, and it returns a {@link ResolvedQualifiedRole} containing the
 *       list of concrete recipients ({@link org.kuali.rice.kew.api.identity.Id}s).</li>
 *   <li>({@link org.kuali.rice.kew.rule.UnqualifiedRoleAttribute} base class can be used to simplify this
 *       two-step process)</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Relationship to WorkflowAttribute: all RoleAttribute implementations are also
 * WorkflowAttribute implementations (is this true? should RoleAttribute extend WorkflowAttribute in that case?)
 * 
 * <p>Methods of WorkflowAttribute interface fulfilled by RoleAttribute:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>??</li>
 * </ol>
 * Methods of WorkflowAttribute interface not relevant to RoleAttribute:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link WorkflowRuleAttribute#isMatch(DocumentContent, List)}</li>
 *   <li>??</li>
 * </ol>
