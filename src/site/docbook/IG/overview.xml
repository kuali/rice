    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>Kuali Rice has the potential to run on most platforms that support a Java development
        environment (not simply a runtime environment), a servlet container, and an Oracle or MySQL
        relational database management system (RDBMS).</para>
    <note>
        <para>Only platforms and configurations that have been tested and are known to work with
            Rice are described within this guide. Other platforms and configurations may work, but
            have not been tested. Please share any configurations that you have gotten to work with
            us by joining our <link xlink:href="http://kuali.org/kis/projectTeams/team/111"

        <title>Suggested Operating Systems</title>
        <para>Since Kuali Rice is written in Java, it should in theory be able to run on any
            operating system that supports the required version of the Java runtime. However, it
            has been most actively tested on: <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Windows (XP, Vista, and 7)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Mac OS X (10.6 and 10.7)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Linux (Ubuntu)</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Note that while Ubuntu Linux is the distribution most frequently used for testing,
            other Linux distributions such as Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Gentoo,
            and others should also be able to run Kuali Rice.</para>
        <para>Additionally, Kuali Rice will likely work on other Unix operating systems such as Sun
            Microsystems Solaris and IBM AIX, although the software has not been tested here.</para>
